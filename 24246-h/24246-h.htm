<h3>Albert Weener Begins</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">1.</span> <span class="num2">I</span> always knew I should write a book.
Something to help tired minds lay aside the cares of the day.
But I always say you never can tell what's around the corner
till you turn it, and everyone has become so accustomed to
fantastic occurrences in the last twenty one years that the inspiring
and relaxing novel I used to dream about would be
today as unreal as Atlantis. Instead, I find I must write of
the things which have happened to me in that time.</p>

<p>It all began with the word itself.</p>

<p>"Grass. Gramina. The family Gramineae. Grasses."</p>

<p>"Oh," I responded doubtfully. The picture in my mind was
only of a vague area in parks edged with benches for the idle.</p>

<p>Anyway, I was far too resentful to pay strict attention. I had
set out in good faith, not for the first time in my career as a
salesman, to answer an ad offering "$50 or more daily to top
producers," naturally expecting the searching onceover of an
alert salesmanager, back to the light, behind a shinytopped
desk. When youve handled as many products as I had an ad
like that has the right sound. But the world is full of crackpots
and some of the most pernicious are those who hoodwink unsuspecting
canvassers into anticipating a sizzling deal where
there is actually only a warm hope. No genuinely highclass
proposition ever came from a layout without aggressiveness
enough to put on some kind of front; working out of an office,
for instance, not an outdated, rundown apartment in the
wrong part of Hollywood.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's only a temporary drawback, Weener, which restricts
the Metamorphizer's efficacy to grasses."</p>

<p>The wheeling syllables, coming in a deep voice from the
middleaged woman, emphasized the absurdity of the whole
business. The snuffy apartment, the unhomelike livingroom&mdash;dust
and books its only furniture&mdash;the unbelievable kitchen,
looking like a pictured warning to housewives, were only guffaws
before the final buffoonery of discovering the J S Francis
who'd inserted that promising ad to be Josephine Spencer
Francis. Wrong location, wrong atmosphere, wrong gender.</p>

<p>Now I'm not the sort of man who would restrict women to
a place in the nursery. No indeed, I believe they are in some
ways just as capable as I am. If Miss Francis had been one of
those wellgroomed, efficient ladies who have earned their place
in the business world without at the same time sacrificing
femininity, I'm sure I would not have suffered such a pang for
my lost time and carfare.</p>

<p>But wellgroomed and feminine were alike inapplicable adjectives.
Towering above me&mdash;she was at least five foot ten
while I am of average height&mdash;she strode up and down the
kitchen which apparently was office and laboratory also, waving
her arms, speaking too exuberantly, the antithesis of moderation
and restraint. She was an aggregate of cylinders, big
and small. Her shapeless legs were columns with large flatheeled
shoes for their bases, supporting the inverted pediment
of great hips. Her too short, greasespotted skirt was a mighty
barrel and on it was placed the tremendous drum of her torso.</p>

<p>"A little more work," she rumbled, "a few interesting problems
solved, and the Metamorphizer will change the basic
structure of any plant inoculated with it."</p>

<p>Large as she was, her face and head were disproportionately
big. Her eyes I can only speak of as enormous. I dare say there
are some who would have called them beautiful. In moments
of intensity they bored into mine and held them till I felt
quite uncomfortable.</p>

<p>"Think of what this discovery means," she urged me.
"Think of it, Weener. Plants will be capable of making use of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
anything within reach. Understand, Weener, anything. Rocks,
quartz, decomposed granite&mdash;anything."</p>

<p>She took a gold victorian toothpick from the pocket of her
mannish jacket and used it energetically. I shuddered. "Unfortunately,"
she went on, a little indistinctly, "unfortunately,
I lack resources for further experiment right now&mdash;"</p>

<p>This too, I thought despairingly. A slight cash investment&mdash;just
enough to get production started&mdash;how many wishful
times Ive heard it. I was a salesman, not a sucker, and anyway
I was for the moment without liquid capital.</p>

<p>"It will change the face of the world, Weener. No more
usedup areas, no more frantic scrabbling for the few bits of
naturally rich ground, no more struggle to get artificial fertilizers
to wornout soil in the face of ignorance and poverty."</p>

<p>She thrust out a hand&mdash;surprisingly finely and economically
molded, barely missing a piledup heap of dishes crowned by
a flowerpot trailing droopy tendrils. Excitedly she paced the
floor largely taken up by jars and flats of vegetation, some
green and flourishing, others gray and sickly, all constricting
her movements as did the stove supporting a glass tank, robbed
of the goldfish which should rightfully have gaped against its
sides and containing instead some slimy growth topped by a
bubbling brown scum. I simply couldnt understand how any
woman could so far oppose what must have been her natural
instinct as to live and work in such a slatternly place. It wasnt
just her kitchen which was disordered and dirty; her person
too was slovenly and possibly unclean. The lank gray hair
swishing about her ears was dark, perhaps from vigor, but
more likely from frugality with soap and water. Her massive,
heavychinned face was untouched by makeup and suggested
an equal innocence of other attentions.</p>

<p>"Fertilizers! Poo! Expedients, Weener&mdash;miserable, makeshift
expedients!" Her unavoidable eyes bit into mine. "What
is a fertilizer? A tidbit, a pap, a lollypop. Indians use fish;
Chinese, nightsoil; agricultural chemists concoct tasty tonics
of nitrogen and potash&mdash;where's your progress? Putting a
mechanical whip on a buggy instead of inventing an internal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
combustion engine. Ive gone directly to the heart of the matter.
Like Watt. Like Maxwell. Like Almroth Wright. No use being
held back because youve only poor materials to work with&mdash;leap
ahead with imagination. Change the plant itself, Weener,
change the plant itself!"</p>

<p>It was no longer politeness which held me. If I could have
freed myself from her eyes I would have escaped thankfully.</p>

<p>"Nourish'm on anything," she shouted, rubbing the round
end of the toothpick vigorously into her ear. "Sow a barren
waste, a worthless slagheap with lifegiving corn or wheat, inoculate
the plants with the Metamorphizer&mdash;and you have a
crop fatter than Iowa's or the Ukraine's best. The whole world
will teem with abundance."</p>

<p>Perhaps&mdash;but what was the sales angle? Where did I come
in? I didnt know a dandelion from a toadstool and was quite
content to keep my distance from nature. Had she inserted the
ad merely to lure a listener? Her whole procedure was irregular:
not a word about territories and commissions. If I could
bring her to the point of mentioning the necessary investment,
maybe I could get away gracefully. "You said you were stuck,"
I prompted, resolved to get the painful interview over with.</p>

<p>"Stuck? Stuck? Oh&mdash;money to perfect the Metamorphizer.
Luckily it will do it itself."</p>

<p>"I don't catch."</p>

<p>"Look about you&mdash;what do you see?"</p>

<p>I glanced around and started to say, a measuring glass on a
dirty plate next to half a cold fried egg, but she stopped me
with a sweep of her arm which came dangerously close to the
flasks and retorts&mdash;all holding dirtycolored liquids&mdash;which cluttered
the sink. "No, no. I mean outside."</p>

<p>I couldnt see outside, because instead of a window I was
facing a sickly leaf unaccountably preserved in a jar of alcohol.
I said nothing.</p>

<p>"Metaphorically, of course. Wheatfields. Acres and acres of
wheat. Bread, wheat, a grass. And cornfields. Iowa, Wisconsin,
Illinois&mdash;not a state in the Union without corn. Milo, oats,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
sorghum, rye&mdash;all grasses. And the Metamorphizer will work
on all of them."</p>

<p>I'm always a man with an open mind. She might&mdash;it was just
possible&mdash;she might have something afterall. But could I work
with her? Go out in the sticks and talk to farmers; learn to sit
on fence rails and whittle, asking after crops as if they were of
interest to me? No, no ... it was fantastic, out of the question.</p>

<p>A different, more practical setup now.... At least there
would have been no lack of prospects, if you wanted to go
miles from civilization to find them; no answers like We never
read magazines, thank you. Of course it was hardly believable
a woman without interest in keeping herself presentable could
invent any such fabulous product, but there was a bare chance
of making a few sales just on the idea.</p>

<p>The idea. It suddenly struck me she had the whole thing
backwards. Grasses, she said, and went on about wheat and
corn and going out to the rubes. Southern California was
dotted with lawns, wasnt it? Why rush around to the hinterland
when there was a big territory next door? And undoubtedly
a better one?</p>

<p>"Revive your old tired lawn," I improvised. "No manures,
fuss, cuss, or muss. One shot of the Meta&mdash;one shot of Francis'
Amazing Discovery and your lawn springs to new life."</p>

<p>"Lawns? Nonsense!" she snorted, rudely, I thought. "Do you
think Ive spent years in order to satisfy suburban vanity?
Lawns indeed!"</p>

<p>"Lawns indeed, Miss Francis," I retorted with some spirit.
"I'm a salesman and I know something about marketing a
product. Yours should be sold to householders for their lawns."</p>

<p>"Should it? Well, I say it shouldnt. Listen to me: there are
two ways of making a discovery. One is to cut off a cat's hindleg.
The discovery is then made that a cat with one leg cut off
has three legs. Hah!</p>

<p>"The other way is to find out your need and then search for
a method of filling it. My work is with plants. I don't take a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
daisy and see if I can make it produce a red and black petaled
monstrosity. If I did I'd be a fashionable horticulturist, delighted
to encourage imbeciles to grow grass in a desert.</p>

<p>"My method is the second one. I want no more backward
countries; no more famines in India or China; no more dustbowls;
no more wars, depressions, hungry children. For this I
produced the Metamorphizer&mdash;to make not two blades of grass
grow where one sprouted before, but whole fields flourish
where only rocks and sandpiles lay.</p>

<p>"No, Weener, it won't do&mdash;I can't trade in my vision as a
downpayment on a means to encourage a waste of ground, seed
and water. You may think I lost such rights when I thought up
the name Metamorphizer to appeal on the popular level, but
there's a difference."</p>

<p>That was a clincher. Anyone who believed Metamorphizer
had salesappeal just wasnt all there. But why should I disillusion
her and wound her pride? Down underneath her rough
exterior I supposed she could be as sensitive as I; and I hope
I am not without chivalry.</p>

<p>I said nothing, but of course her interdiction of the only
possibility killed any weakening inclination. And yet ...
yet.... Afterall, I had to have <i>something</i>....</p>

<p>"All right, Weener. This pump&mdash;" she produced miraculously
from the jumble an unwieldy engine dragging a long
and tangling tail of hose behind it, the end lost among mementos
of unfinished meals "&mdash;this pump is full of the Metamorphizer,
enough to inoculate a hundred and fifty acres when
added in proper proportion to the irrigating water. I have a
table worked out to show you about that. The tank holds five
gallons; get $50 a gallon&mdash;a dollar and a half an acre and keep
ten percent for yourself. Be sure to return the pump every
night."</p>

<p>I had to say for her that when she got down to business she
didnt waste any words. Perhaps this contrasting directness so
startled me I was roped in before I could refuse. On the other
hand, of course, I would be helping out someone who needed
my assistance badly, since she couldnt, with all the obvious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
factors against her, be having a very easy time. Sometimes it
is advisable to temper business judgment with kindness.</p>

<p>Her first offer was ridiculous in its assumption that a salesman's
talent, skill and effort were worth only a miserable ten
percent, as though I were a literary agent with something a
cinch to sell. I began to feel more at home as we ironed out
the details and I brought the knowledge acquired with much
hard work and painful experience into the bargaining. Fifty
percent I wanted and fifty percent I finally got by demanding
seventyfive. She became as interested in the contest as she had
been before in benefits to humanity and I perceived a keen
mind under all her eccentricity.</p>

<p>I can't truthfully say I got to like her, but I reconciled myself
and eventually was on my way with the pump&mdash;a trifling weight
to Miss Francis, judging by the way she handled it, but uncomfortably
heavy to me&mdash;strapped to my back and ten feet of
recalcitrant hose coiled round my shoulder. She turned her
imperious eyes on me again and repeated for the fourth or fifth
time the instructions for applying, as though I were less intelligent
than she. I went out through the barren livingroom and
took a backward glance at the scaling stucco walls of the apartmenthouse,
shaking my head. It was a queer place for Albert
Weener, the crackerjack salesman who had once led his team in
a national contest to put over a threepiece aluminum deal, to
be working out of. And for a woman. And for such a woman....</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">2.</span> <span class="num2">E</span>verything is for the best, is my
philosophy and Make your cross your crutch is a good thought
to hold; so I reminded myself that it takes fewer muscles to
smile than to frown and no one sees the bright side of things if
he wears dark glasses. Since it takes all kinds to make a world
and Josephine Spencer Francis was one of those kinds, wasnt
it only reasonable to suppose there were other kinds who would
buy the stuff she'd invented? The only way to sell something
is first to sell yourself and I piously went over the virtues of the
Metamorphizer in my mind. What if by its very nature there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
could be no repeat business? I wasnt tying myself to it for life.</p>

<p>All that remained was to find myself a customer. I tried to
recall the location of the nearest rural territory. San Fernando
valley, probably&mdash;a long, tiresome trip. And expensive, unless
I wished to demean myself by thumbing rides&mdash;a difficult thing
to do, burdened as I was by the pump. If she hadnt balked unreasonably
about putting the stuff on lawns, I'd have prospects
right at hand.</p>

<p>I was suddenly lawnconscious. There was probably not a
Los Angeles street I hadnt covered at some time&mdash;magazines,
vacuums, old gold, nearnylons&mdash;and I must have been aware
of green spaces before most of the houses, but now for the first
time I saw lawns. Neat, sharply confined, smoothshaven lawns.
Sagging, slipping, eager-to-keep-up-appearances but fighting-a-losing-game
lawns. Ragged, weedy, dissolute lawns. Halfbare,
repulsively crippled, hummocky lawns. Bright lawns, insistent
on former respectability and trimness; yellow and gray lawns,
touched with the craziness of age, quite beyond all interest in
looks, content to doze easily in the sun. If Miss Francis' mixture
was on the upandup and she hadnt introduced a perfectly unreasonable
condition&mdash;why, I couldnt miss.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I thought suddenly, I'm the salesman,
not she. It was up to me as a practical man to determine where
and how I could sell to the best advantage. With sudden resolution
I walked over a twinkling greensward and rang the bell.</p>

<p>"Good afternoon, madam. I can see from your garden youre
a lady who's interested in keeping it lovely."</p>

<p>"Not my garden and Mrs Smith's not home." The door shut.
Not gently.</p>

<p>The next house had no lawn at all, but was fronted with a
rank growth of ivy. I felt no one had a right to plant ivy when
I was selling something effective only on the family Gramineae.
I tramped over the ivy hard and rang the doorbell on the other
side.</p>

<p>"Good afternoon, madam. I can see from the appearance of
your lawn youre a lady who really cares for her garden. I'm
introducing to a restricted group&mdash;just one or two in each<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
neighborhood&mdash;a new preparation, an astounding discovery by
a renowned scientist which will make your grass twice as green
and many times as vigorous upon one application, without the
aid of anything else, natural or artificial."</p>

<p>"My gardener takes care of all that."</p>

<p>"But, madam&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There is a city ordinance against unlicensed solicitors.
Have you a license, young man?"</p>

<p>After the fifth refusal I began to think less unkindly of Miss
Francis' idea of selling the stuff to farmers and to wonder what
was wrong with my technique. After some understandable hesitation&mdash;for
I don't make a practice of being odd or conspicuous&mdash;I
sat down on the curb to think. Besides, the pump was getting
wearisomely heavy. I couldnt decide exactly what was unsatisfactory
in my routine. The stuff had neither been used nor
advertised, so there could be no prejudice against it; no one
had yet allowed me to get so far as quoting price, so it wasnt
too expensive.</p>

<p>The process of elimination brought me to the absurd conclusion
that the fault must lie in me. Not in my appearance, I
reasoned, for I was a personable young man, a little over thirty
at the time, with no obvious defects a few visits to the dentist
wouldnt have removed. Of course I do have an unfortunate
skin condition, but such a thing's an act of God, as the lawyers
say, and people must take me as I am.</p>

<p>No, it wasnt my appearance ... or was it? That monstrously
outsized pump! Who wanted to listen to a salestalk
from a man apparently prepared for an immediate gasattack?
There is little use in pressing your trousers between two boards
under the mattress if you discount such neatness with the accouterment
of an invading Martian. I uncoiled the hose from
my shoulder and eased the incubus from my back. Leaving
them visible from the corner of my eye, I crossed the most
miserable lawn yet encountered.</p>

<p>It was composed of what I since learned is Bermuda, a plant
most Southern Californians call&mdash;with many profane prefixes&mdash;devilgrass.
It was yellow, the dirty, grayish yellow of moldy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
straw; and bald, scuffed spots immodestly exposed the cracked,
parched earth beneath. Over the walk, interwoven stolons had
been felted down into a ragged mat, repellent alike to foot and
eye. Perversely, onto what had once been flowerbeds, the runners
crept erect, bristling spines showing faintly green on top&mdash;the
only live color in the miserable expanse. Where the grass
had gone to seed there were patches of muddy purple, patches
which enhanced rather than relieved the diseased color of the
whole and emphasized the dying air of the yard. It was a
neglected, unvalued thing; an odious appendage, a mistake
never rectified.</p>

<p>"Madam," I began, "your lawn is deplorable." There was no
use giving her the line about I-can-see-you-are-a-lady-who-cares-for-lovely-things.
Anyway, now the pump was off my back I
felt reckless. I threw the whole book of salesmanship away.
"It's the most neglected lawn in the neighborhood. It is,
madam, I'm sorry to say, no less than a disgrace."</p>

<p>She was a woman beyond the age of childbearing, her dress
revealing the outlines of her corset, and she looked at me coldly
through rimless glassing biting the bridge of her inadequate
nose. "So what?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Madam," I said, "for ten dollars I can make this the finest
lawn in the block, the pride of your family and the envy of
your neighbors."</p>

<p>"I can do better things with ten dollars than spend it on a
bunch of dead grass."</p>

<p>Gratefully I knew I had her then and was glad I hadnt weakly
given in to an impulse to carry out the crackpot's original instructions.
When they start to argue, my motto is, theyre sold.
I took a good breath and wound up for the clincher.</p>

<p>I won't say she was an easy sale, but afterall I'm a psychologist;
I found all her weak points and touched them expertly.
Even so, she made me cut my price in half, leaving me only
twofifty according to my agreement with Miss Francis, but it
was an icebreaker.</p>

<p>I got the pump and hose, collecting at the same time an audience
of brats who assisted me by shouting, "What ya goin a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
do, mister?" "What's at thing for, mister?" "You goin a water
Mrs Dinkman's frontyard, mister?" "Do your teeth awwis look
so funny, mister? My grampa takes his teeth out at night and
puts'm in a glass of water. Do you take out your teeth at night,
mister?" "You goin a put that stuff on our garden too, mister?"
"Hay, Shirley&mdash;come on over and see the funnylooking man
who's fixing up Dinkman's yard."</p>

<p>They were untiring, shrilling their questions, exclamations
and comments, completely driving from my mind the details
of the actual application of the Metamorphizer. Anyway, Miss
Francis had been concerned with putting it in the irrigation
water&mdash;which didnt apply in this case. I thought a moment. A
gallon was enough for thirty acres; half a pint should suffice
for this&mdash;more than suffice. Irrigation water, nonsense&mdash;I'd
squirt it on and tell the woman to hose it down afterward&mdash;that'd
be the same as putting it in the water, wouldnt it?</p>

<p>To come to this practical conclusion under the brunt of the
children's assault was a remarkable feat. As I dribbled the stuff
over the sorry devilgrass they kicked the pump&mdash;and my shins&mdash;mimicking
my actions, tripping me as they skipped under my
legs, getting wet with the Metamorphizer&mdash;I hoped with mutually
deleterious effect&mdash;and generally making me more than
ever thankful for my bachelor condition.</p>

<p>Twofifty, I thought, angrily squirting a fine mist at a particularly
dreary spot&mdash;and it isnt even selling. Manual labor.
Working with my hands. I might as well be a gardener. College
training. Wide experience. Alert and aggressive. In order to
dribble stuff smelling sickeningly of carnations on a wasted
yard. I coiled up my hose disgustedly and collected a reluctant
five dollars.</p>

<p>"It don't look any different," commented Mrs Dinkman
dubiously.</p>

<p>"Madam, Professor Francis' remarkable discovery works
miracles, but not in the twinkling of an eye. In a week youll
see for yourself, provided of course you wet it down properly."</p>

<p>"In a week youll be far gone with my five dollars," diagnosed
Mrs Dinkman.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>While this might be superficially true, it was an unfair and
unkind thing to say, and it wounded me. I reached into my
pocket and drew out an old card&mdash;one printed before I'd had
an irreconcilable difference with the firm employing me at the
time.</p>

<p>"I can always be reached at this address, Mrs Dinkman," I
said, "should you have any cause for dissatisfaction&mdash;which I'm
sure is quite impossible. Besides, I shall be daily in this district
demonstrating the value of Dr Francis' Lawn Tonic."</p>

<p>That was certainly true; unless I made a better connection.
Degrading manual labor or not, I intended to sell as many
local people as possible on the strength of having found a weak
spot in the wall of salesresistance before the effects of the
Metamorphizer became apparent. For, in strict confidence,
and despite its being an undesirable negative attitude, I was a
little dubious that those effects&mdash;or lack of them&mdash;would stimulate
further sales.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">3.</span> <span class="num2">M</span>y alarmclock, as it did every morning,
Sundays included, rang at sixthirty, for I am a man of
habit. I turned it off, remembering instantly I had given Miss
Francis neither her pump nor her share of the sale. Of course
it was more convenient and timesaving to bring them both
together and I was sure she didnt expect me to follow instructions
to the letter, like an officeboy, any more in these matters
than she had in her restriction to agricultural use.</p>

<p>Still, it was remiss of me. The fact is, I had spent her money
as well as my own&mdash;not on dissipation, I hasten to say, but on
dinner and an installment of my roomrent. This was embarrassing,
but I looked upon it merely as an advance&mdash;quite as if
I'd had the customary drawingaccount&mdash;to be charged against
my next commissions. My acceptance of the advance merely
indicated my faith in the future of the Metamorphizer.</p>

<p>I dissolved a yeastcake in a glass of water; it's very healthy
and I'd heard it alleviated dermal irritations. Lathering my
face, I glanced over the list culled from the dictionary and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
stuck in the mirror the night before, for I have never been
too tired to improve my mind. By this easy method of increasing
my vocabulary I had progressed, at the time, down to the
letter K.</p>

<p>While drinking my coffee&mdash;never more than two cups&mdash;it was
my custom to read and digest stock and bond quotations, for
though I had no investments&mdash;the only time I had been able
to take a flurry there was an unforeseen recession in the market&mdash;I
thought a man who didnt keep up with trends and conditions
unfitted for a place in the businessworld. Besides, I didnt
expect to be straitened indefinitely and I believed in being
ready to take proper advantage of opportunity when it came.</p>

<p>As a man may devote the graver part of his mind to a subject
and then turn for relaxation to a lighter aspect, so I had for
years been interested in a stock called Consolidated Pemmican
and Allied Concentrates. It wasnt a highpriced issue, nor were
its fluctuations startling. For six months of the year, year in
and year out, it would be quoted at 1/16 of a cent a share; for
the other six months it stood at 1/8. I didnt know what pemmican
was and I didnt particularly care, but if a man could
invest at 1/16 he could double his money overnight when it
rose to 1/8. Then he could reverse the process by selling before
it went down and so snowball into fortune. It was a daydream,
but a harmless one.</p>

<p>Satisfying myself Consolidated Pemmican was bumbling
along at its low level, I reluctantly prepared to resume Miss
Francis' pump. It seemed less heavy as I wound the hose over
my shoulder and I felt this wasnt due to the negligible quantity
I'd expended on Mrs Dinkman's grass. I just knew I was
going to have a successful day. I had to.</p>

<p>In moments of fancy I often think a salesman is more truly
a creative artist than many of those who arrogate the title to
themselves. He uses words, on one hand, and the receptivity of
prospects on the other, to mold a cohesive and satisfying whole,
a work of Art, signed and dated on the dotted line. Like any
such work, the creation implies thoughtful and careful preparation.
So it was that I got off the bus, polishing a new salestalk<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
to fit the changed situation. "One of your neighbors ..."
"I have just applied ..." I sneered my way past those houses
refusing my services the day before; they couldnt have the
Metamorphizer at any price now. Then it hit my eyes.</p>

<p>Mrs Dinkman's lawn, I mean.</p>

<p>The one so neglected, ailing and yellow only yesterday.</p>

<p>It wasnt sad and sickly now. The most enthusiastic homeowner
wouldnt have disdained it. There wasnt a single bare
spot visible in the whole lush, healthy expanse. And it was
green. Green. Not just here and there, but over every inch of
soft, undulating surface; a pale applegreen where the blades
waved to expose its underparts and a rich, dazzling emerald
on top. Even the runners, sinuously encroaching upon the sidewalk,
were deeply virescent.</p>

<p>The Metamorphizer worked.</p>

<p>The Metamorphizer not only worked, but it worked with
unbelievable rapidity. Overnight. I knew nothing about the
speed at which ordinary fertilizers, plant stimulants or hormones
took hold, but commonsense told me nothing like this
had ever happened so quickly. I had been indulging in a little
legitimate puffery in saying the inoculant worked miracles, but
if anything that had been an understatement. It just went to
show how impossible it is for a real salesman to be too enthusiastic.</p>

<p>Nerves in knees and fingers quivering, I walked over to join
the group curiously inspecting the translated lawn. I, <i>I</i> had
done this; out of the most miserable I'd made the loveliest&mdash;and
for a paltry five dollars. I tried to recapture the memory
of what it had looked like in order to relish the contrast more,
but it was impossible; the vivid present blotted out the decayed
past completely.</p>

<p>"Overnight," someone said. "Yessir, just overnight.
Wouldnt of believed it if I hadnt noticed just yesterday how
much worse an the city dump it looked."</p>

<p>"Bet at stuff's ten inches high."</p>

<p>"Brother, you can say that again. Foot'd be closer."</p>

<p>"Anyhow it's uh fattestlookin grass I seen sence I lef Texas."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>"An the greenest. Guess I never did see such a green before."</p>

<p>While they exclaimed about the beauty and vigor of the
growth, my mind was racing in high along practical lines.
Achievement isnt worth much unless you can harness it, and
in today's triumph I saw tomorrow's benefit. No more canvassing
with a pump undignifiedly on my back, no more manual
labor; no, bold as the thought was, not even any more direct
selling for me. This was big, too big to be approached in any
cockroach, build-up-slowly-from-the-bottom way. It was a real
top deal, in a class with nylon or jukeboxes or bubblegum.
You could smell the money in it.</p>

<p>First of all I'd have to tie Josephine Francis down with an
ironclad contract. Agents; dealerships; distributors and a general
salesmanager, Albert Weener, at the top. Incorporate. Get
it all down in black and white and signed by Miss Francis right
away. For her own good. An idealistic scientist, a frail woman,
protect her from the vultures who'd try to rob her as soon as
they saw what the Metamorphizer would do. Such a woman
wouldnt have any business sense. I'd see she got a comfortable
living out of it and free her from responsibility. Then she could
potter around all she liked.</p>

<p>Incorporate. Interest big money. Put it on a nationwide
basis. A cut for the general salesmanager on every sale. Besides
stock. Take the patent in the company's name. In six months
I'd be on my way to being a millionaire. I had certainly been
right up on my toes in picking the Metamorphizer as a winner
in spite of Miss Francis' kitchen and her lack of aggressiveness.
Instinct, the unerring instinct of a wideawake salesman for the
right product&mdash;and for the right market. I mustnt forget that.
Had I been content with her original limitation I'd still be
bumbling around trying to interest Farmer Hicks in some
Metamorphizer for his hay.</p>

<p>"Ja notice how thick it was?"</p>

<p>"Well, that's Bermuda for you. Tell me they actually plant
it on purpose in Florida."</p>

<p>"No kiddin?"</p>

<p>"Yessir. Know one thing&mdash;even if it looks pretty right now,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
I wouldnt want that stuff on my place. Have to cut it every
day."</p>

<p>"Bet ya. Toughlookin too. I rather take my exercise in bed."</p>

<p>That's an angle, I thought&mdash;have to get old lady Francis to
modify her formula or something. Else we'll never get rich.
Slow down the rate of growth, dilute it&mdash;ought to be more
profitable too.... Have to find out how cheaply the inoculant
can be produced&mdash;no more inefficient hand methods....
Of course the fastness of growth wouldnt affect the sale to
farmers&mdash;help it in fact. No doubt she'd had more than I originally
thought in that aspect, I conceded generously. We could
let them apply it themselves ... mailorder advertising ...
cut costs that way.... Think of clover and alfalfa&mdash;or werent
they grasses? Anyway, imagine hay or wheat as tall as Iowa
corn and corn higher than a smalltown cityhall! Fortune&mdash;there'd
be a dozen fortunes in it.</p>

<p>I began perspiring. The deal was getting bigger and bigger.
It wasnt just a simple matter of cutting in on a good thing.
All the angles, which were multiplying at a tremendous rate,
had to be covered before I saw Miss Francis again; I darent
miss any bets. I needed a staff of agricultural experts&mdash;anyway
someone who could cover the scientific side. Whatever happened
to my freshman chemistry? And a mob of lawyers; you'd
have to plug every loophole&mdash;tight. But here I was without a
financial resource&mdash;couldnt hire a ditchdigger, much less the
highpriced talent I needed&mdash;and someone else might get a
brainstorm when he saw the lawn and beat me to it. I visioned
myself cheated of my million....</p>

<p>Yes ... a really fast worker&mdash;some unethical promoter
willing to stoop to devious methods&mdash;might pass at any moment
and grasp the possibilities, have Miss Francis signed up before
I'd even got the deal straight in my mind. How could he miss,
seeing this lawn? Splendid, magnificent, beautiful. No one
would ever call this stuff devilgrass&mdash;angelgrass would be more
appropriate to the implications of such a heavenly green.
Millions in it&mdash;simply millions....</p>

<p>"Say&mdash;arent you the fellow put this stuff on?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>Halfadozen vacant faces gaped at me, the burdening pump,
the caudal hose. Curiosity, interest, imbecile amusement
argued in their expression with the respect due the worker
of the transformation; it was the sort of look connected with
salesresistance of the most obstinate kind. They distracted me
from thinking things through.</p>

<p>"Miz Dinkman's sure looking for you. Says she's going to sue
you."</p>

<p>Here was an unfortunate development, an angle to end all
angles. Unfavorable publicity, the abortifacient of new enterprises,
would mean you could hardly give the stuff away. My
imagination raced through columns of newsprint in which the
Metamorphizer was made the butt of reporters' humor. Mrs
Dinkman's ire would have to be placated, bought off. Perhaps
I'd better discuss developments with Miss Francis right away,
afterall.</p>

<p>Whatever I decided, it was advisable for me to leave this
vicinity. I was in no financial position to soothe Mrs Dinkman
and it was dubious, in view of her attitude, whether it would
be possible to sell any more in the immediate neighborhood.
Probably a new territory was the answer to my problem; a few
sales would give me both cash in hand and time to think.</p>

<p>While I hesitated, Mrs Dinkman, belligerency dancing like
a sparkling aura about her, came out of her garage with a rusty,
rattling lawnmower. I'm no authority on gardentools, but this
creaking, rickety machine was clearly no match for the lusty
growth. The audience felt so too, and there was a stir of sporting
interest as they settled down to watch the contest.</p>

<p>Determination was implicit in the sharply unnatural lines
of her corset and the firm set of her glasses as she charged into
the gently swaying runners. The wheels turned rebelliously,
the mower bit, its rusty blades grated against the knife, something
clanked forcibly and the machine stopped. Mrs. Dinkman
pushed, her back arched with effort&mdash;the mower didnt
budge. She pulled it back. It whirred gratefully; the clanking
stopped and she tried again. This time it chewed a handful of
grass from the edge, found it distasteful and quit once more.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>"Anybody know how to make this damn thing work?" Mrs
Dinkman asked exasperatedly.</p>

<p>"Needs oil" was helpfully volunteered.</p>

<p>She retired into the garage and returned with a lopsided oilcan.
"Oil it," she commanded regally. The helpful one reluctantly
pressed his thumb against the wry bottom of the can,
aiming the twisted spout at odd parts of the mower. "I dunno,"
he commented.</p>

<p>"I don't either," said Mrs Dinkman. "You&mdash;Greener,
Weener&mdash;whatever your name is!"</p>

<p>There was no possibility of evasion. "Yes, mam?"</p>

<p>"You made this stuff grow; now you can cut it down."</p>

<p>Uncouth guffaws from the watching idiots.</p>

<p>"Mrs Dinkman, I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Get behind that lawnmower, young man, if you don't want
to be involved in a lawsuit."</p>

<p>I wasnt afraid of such a consequence in itself, having at the
moment nothing to attach, but I thought of Miss Francis and
future sales and that impalpable thing known as "goodwill."
"Yes, mam," I repeated.</p>

<p>I discarded pump and hose to move reluctantly toward the
mower. Under my feet I felt the springiness of the grass; was
it pure fancy&mdash;or did it truly differ in quality from the lawns
I'd trod so indifferently the day before?</p>

<p>I took the handle. If oiling had improved the machine, its
previous efficiency must have been slight. It went shakily over
the first inch of grass and then, as it had for Mrs Dinkman, it
stopped for me.</p>

<p>By now the spectators had increased to a small crowd and
their dull humor had taken the form of cheerfully offering
much gratuitous advice. "Tie into it, Slim&mdash;build up the old
muscle." "Back her up and take a good run." "Go home an
do some settinup exercises&mdash;come back next year." "Got to put
the old back behind it, Bud&mdash;give her the gas." "Need a decent
mower&mdash;no use trying to cut stuff like that with an antique."
"Yeah&mdash;get a good mower&mdash;one made since the Civil War."
"No one around here got an honestogod lawnmower?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>The last query evidently nettled local pride, for soon a
blithe, beamshouldered little man trundled up a shiny, rubbertired
machine. "Thisll do the business," he announced
confidently as I relinquished the spotlight to him with understandable
readiness. "It's a regular jimdandy."</p>

<p>It certainly was. The devilgrass came irreverently above
the wheels and flowed with graceful inquisitiveness over the
blades, but the brisk little man pushed heartily and the mechanism
revolved with a barely audible clicking. It did not balk,
complain or hesitate. Cleanly severed ends of grass whirled
into the air and floated down on the neat smooth swath left
behind. Everyone smiled relievedly at the jimdandy's triumph
and my sigh was loudest and most heartfelt. I edged away as
unobtrusively as I could.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">4.</span> <span class="num2">I</span> have no sympathy with weaklings
who complain of the cards being stacked, but it did seem as
though fate were dealing unkindly with me. Here was a good
proposition, coming just at the time I needed it most and it
was turning bad rapidly. Walking the short distance to Miss
Francis' I was unable to settle my mind, to strike a mental
balancesheet. There was money; there had to be money&mdash;lots
and lots of it&mdash;in the Metamorphizer, but it was possible there
was trouble&mdash;lots and lots of it&mdash;also. The thing was, well,
dangerous. What was the use of expending ability in selling
something which could have kickbacks acting as deterrents to
future sales? Of course a man had to take risks....</p>

<p>The door, after a properly prudent hesitation, clicked
brokenly. Miss Francis looked as though she'd added insomnia
to her other abstentions, otherwise she had not changed, even
to her skirt and the smudge on her left nostril. "If youve come
about the icebox youre a week late. I fixed it myself," she
greeted me gruffly.</p>

<p>"Weener," I reminded her, "Albert Weener&mdash;remember?
I'm selling&mdash;that is, I'm going to sell the product you invented
to make plants eat anything."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh. Weener&mdash;yes." She produced the toothpick and
scratched her chin with it. "About the Metamorphizer." She
paused and rubbed her elbow. "A mistake, I'm afraid. An
error."</p>

<p>Aha, I thought, a new deal. Someone's offered to back her.
Steal her brainchild, negate all my efforts to make her independent
and cheat me of the reward of my spadework. You
wouldnt think of her as a frail credulous woman, easily taken
in by the first smooth talker, but a woman is a woman afterall.</p>

<p>"Look, Miss Francis," I argued, "youve got a big thing here,
a great thing. The possibilities are practically unlimited. Of
course youll have to have a manager to put it across&mdash;an executive,
a man with business experience&mdash;someone who can tap
the great reservoir of buying power by the conviction of a new
need. Organize a sales campaign; rationalize production. Put
the whole thing on a commercial basis. For all this you need
a man who has contacted the public on every level&mdash;preferably
doortodoor and with a varied background."</p>

<p>She strode past the stove, which had gathered new accreta
during the night and looked in the cloudy mirror as though
searching for a misplaced thought. "No doubt, Weener, no
doubt. But before all these romantically streamlined things
eventuate there must be a hiatus. In my haste I overlooked a
detail yesterday, trivial maybe&mdash;perhaps vital. I should never
have let you start out so soon."</p>

<p>This was bad; I was struggling now for my job and for the
future of the Metamorphizer. "Miss Francis, I don't know
what you mean by mistakes or trivial details or how I could
have started out too soon, but whatever the trouble is I'm sure
it can be smoothed out easily. Sometimes, you know, obstacles
which appear tremendous prove to be nothing at all in experienced
hands. I myself have had occasion to put things right
for a number of different concerns. Really, Miss Francis, you
mustnt let opportunity slip through your fingers. Believe me,
I know what a big thing your discovery is&mdash;Ive seen what it
does."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>She turned those too sharp eyes on me discomfortingly.
"Ah," she said, "so soon?"</p>

<p>"Well," I began, "it certainly acted quickly ..."</p>

<p>I stopped when I saw she wasnt hearing me. She sat down
in the only empty chair and drummed her fingers against big
white teeth. "Even under a microscope," she muttered, "no
perceptible reaction for fortyeight hours. Laboratory conditions?
Or my own idiocy? But I approximated ..." Her voice
trailed off and for a full minute the absolute silence of the
kitchen was broken only by the melodramatic dripping of a
tap.</p>

<p>She made an effort to pull herself together and addressed me
in her old abrupt way. "Corn or wheat?"</p>

<p>"Ay?"</p>

<p>"You said youve seen what it does. I asked you if you had
applied it to corn or wheat&mdash;or what?"</p>

<p>She was looking at me so fixedly I had a slight difficulty in
putting my words in good order. "It was neither, mam. I applied
some of the stuff to a lawn&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A <i>lawn</i>, Weener?"</p>

<p>"Y-yes, mam."</p>

<p>"But I said&mdash;"</p>

<p>"General instructions, Miss Francis. I'm sure you didnt mean
to tie my hands."</p>

<p>Another long silence.</p>

<p>"No, Weener&mdash;I didnt mean to tie your hands."</p>

<p>"Well, as I was saying, I applied some of the stuff to a lawn.
Exactly according to your instructions&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In the irrigation water?"</p>

<p>"Well, not precisely. But just as good, I assure you."</p>

<p>"Go on."</p>

<p>"A terrible lawn. All shot. Last night. This morning&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop. What kind of grass? Or don't you know?"</p>

<p>"Of course I know," I answered indignantly. Did she think
I was an idiot? "It was devilgrass."</p>

<p>"Ah." She rubbed the back of her hand against her singularly
smooth cheek. "Bermuda. <i>Cynodon dactylon.</i> Stupid,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
stupid, stupid. How could I have been so blind? Did I think
only the corn would be affected and not the weeds in the furrows?
Or that something like this might not happen?"</p>

<p>I didnt feel like wasting any more time listening to her
soliloquy. "This morning," I continued, "it was as green&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All right, Weener, spare me your poetry. Show it to me."</p>

<p>"Well now, Miss Francis ..." I wanted, understandably
enough, to discuss future arrangements before she saw Dinkman's
lawn.</p>

<p>"Immediately, Weener."</p>

<p>When dealing with childish persons you have to cater to
their whims. I rid myself of the pump&mdash;I'd never dreamed I'd
be reluctant to part with the monster&mdash;while she made perfunctory
and unconvincing motions to fit herself for the street.
Of course she neither washed nor madeup, but she peered in
the glass argumentatively, pulled her jacket down decisively,
threw her shoulders back to raise it askew again and gave the
swirl of hair a halfhearted pat.</p>

<p>"I'd like to go over the matter of organizing&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not now."</p>

<p>I was naturally reluctant to be seen on the street with so
conspicuous a figure, but I could hardly escape. I tried to match
her swinging stride, but as she was at least six inches taller I
had to give a sort of skip between steps, which was less than
dignified. Searching my mind to find a tactful approach again
to the subject of proper distribution of the Metamorphizer, I
felt my opportunity slipping away every moment. She, on her
part, was silent and so abstracted that I often had to put out a
guiding hand to avert collision with other pedestrians or stationary
objects.</p>

<p>I doubt if I'd been gone from Mrs Dinkman's threequarters
of an hour. I had left a small group excited at the free show
consequent upon the too successful beautification of a local
eyesore; I returned to a sizable crowd viewing an impressive
phenomenon. The homely levity had vanished; no one shouted
jovial advice. Opinions and comments passed in whispers accompanied
by furtive glances toward the lawn, as though it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
were sentient and might be offended by rude speculation. As
we pushed through the bystanders I was suddenly aware of
their cautious avoidance of contact with the grass itself. The
nearest onlookers stood a respectful yard back and when unbalanced
by the push of those behind went through such antics
to avoid treading on it, while at the same time preserving the
convention of innocence of any taboo that they frequently
pivoted and pirouetted on one foot in an awkward ballet. The
very hiding of their inhibition emphasized the new awesomeness
of the grass; it was no longer to be lightly approached or
frivolously treated.</p>

<p>Now I am not what is generally called a man of religious
sensibilities, having long ago discarded belief in the supernatural;
and I am not overcome at odd moments by mystical
feelings. Furthermore I had been intimate with this particular
patch of vegetation for some eighteen hours. I had viewed its
decaying state; I had injected life into it; I had seen it in the
first flush of resurrection. In spite of all this, I too fell under
the spell of the grass and knew something compounded of
wonder and apprehension.</p>

<p>The neatly cut swaths of the little man with the jimdandy
mower came to a dramatic end in the middle of the yard.
Beyond this shorn portion the grass rose in a threatening crest,
taller than a man's knees; green, aloof and derisive. But it was
not this forbidding sight which gave me such a queer turn. It
was the mown part; for I recalled how the brisk man's machine
had cut close and left behind short, crisp stems. Now this piece
was almost as high as when I'd first seen it&mdash;grown faster in an
hour than ordinary grass in a month.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">5.</span> <span class="num2">I</span> stole a look at Miss Francis to see
how she was taking the sight, but there was no emotion visible
on her face. The toothpick was once more in play and the
luminous eyes fixed straight ahead. Her legs were spread apart
and she seemed firmly in position for hours to come, as though<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
she would wait for the grass to exhaust its phenomenal growth.</p>

<p>"Why did they quit cutting?" I asked the man standing
beside me.</p>

<p>"Mower give out&mdash;dulled the blades so they wouldnt cut no
more."</p>

<p>"Going to give up and let it grow?"</p>

<p>"Hell, no. Sent for a gardener with a powermower. Big one.
Cut anything. Ought to be here now."</p>

<p>He was, too, honking the crowd from the driveway. Mrs
Dinkman was with him, looking at once indignant, persecuted,
uncomfortable and selfrighteous. It was evident they had failed
to reach any agreement.</p>

<p>The gardener slammed the door of the senescent truck with
vehement lack of affection. "I cut lots a devilgrass, lady, but I
won't tie into this overgrown stuff at that price. You got no
right to expect it. I know what's fair and it's not reasonable to
count on me cutting this like it was an ordinary lawn. You
know yourself it isnt fair."</p>

<p>"I'll give you ten dollars and that's my last word."</p>

<p>"Listen, lady, when I get through this job I'll have to take
my mower apart and have it resharpened. You think I can
afford to do that for a tendollar job?"</p>

<p>"Ten dollars," repeated Mrs Dinkman firmly.</p>

<p>The gardener appealed to the gallery. "Listen, folks: now
I ask you&mdash;is this fair? I'm willing to be reasonable. I understand
this lady's in trouble and I'm willing to help, but I can't
do a twentyfivedollar job for ten bucks, can I?"</p>

<p>It was doubtful if the observers were particularly concerned
with justice; what they desired was action, swift and drastic.
A general resentment at being balked of their amusement was
manifest in murmurs of "Go ahead, do it." "What's the matter
with you?" "Don't be dumb&mdash;do it for nothing&mdash;youll get
plenty business out of it." They appealed to his nobler and
baser natures, but he remained adamant.</p>

<p>Not to be balked by his churlishness, they passed a hat and
collected $8.67, which I thought a remarkably generous admission
price. When this was added to Mrs Dinkman's ten<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
dollars the gardener, still protesting, reluctantly agreed to
perform.</p>

<p>Mrs Dinkman prudently holding the total, he unloaded the
powermower with many flourishes, making quite an undertaking
of oiling and adjusting the roller, setting the blades;
bending down to assure himself of the gasoline in the small
tank, finally wheeling the contraption into place with great
spirit. The motor started with a disgruntled put! changing into
a series of resigned explosions as he guided it over the lawn
crosswise to the lines of his predecessor. Miss Francis followed
every motion with rapt attention.</p>

<p>"Did you expect this?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Ay? The abnormally stimulated growth, you mean?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Yes and no. Work in the laboratory didnt indicate it. My
own fault; I didnt realize at once making available so much
free nitrogen would have such instant results. But last night&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"Not now. Later."</p>

<p>The powermower went nicely, I might almost say smoothly,
over the stuff cut before, muttering and chickling happily to
itself as it dragged the panting gardener, inescapably harnessed,
in its wake. But the mown area was narrow and the
machine quickly jerked through it and made the last easy
journey along the wall of untouched devilgrass beyond.</p>

<p>The gardener, without hesitation, aimed his machine at the
thicket of grass. It growled, slowed, coughed, spat, struggled
and thrashed on and finally conked out.</p>

<p>"Ah," said Miss Francis.</p>

<p>"Oh," said the spectators.</p>

<p>"Sonofabitch," said the gardener.</p>

<p>He yanked the grumbling mower back angrily, inspecting
its mechanism in the manner of a mother with a wayward son
and began again. There was desperate determination in his
shoulders as he added his forward thrust to the protesting
rhythm. The machine went at the grass like a bulldog attacking
a borzoi: it bit, chewed, held on. It cut a new six inches<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
readily, another foot slowly&mdash;and then with jolts and misfires
and loud imprecations from the gardener, it gave up again.</p>

<p>"You," judged Mrs Dinkman, "don't know how to cut
grass."</p>

<p>The gardener wiped his sweaty forehead with the inside of
his wrist. "You&mdash;you should have a law against you," he answered
bitterly and inadequately.</p>

<p>But the crowd evidently agreed with Mrs Dinkman's verdict,
for there were mutterings of "It's a farmer's job." "Get
somebody with a scythe." "That's right&mdash;get a scythe." "Got to
have a scythe to cut hay like that." These remarks, uttered
loudly enough for him to hear, so discouraged the gardener
that after three more futile tries he reloaded his equipment and
left amidst jeers and expressions of disfavor without attempting
to collect any of the money.</p>

<p>For some reason the failure of the powermower lightened
the atmosphere. Everyone, including Mrs Dinkman, seemed
convinced that scything was the solution. Tension relaxed and
the bystanders began talking in something above a whisper.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">6.</span> <span class="num2">"T</span>his will just about ruin our sales,"
I said.</p>

<p>Miss Francis suspended the toothpick before her chin and
looked at me as though I'd said dirty words in the presence
of ladies.</p>

<p>"Well it will," I argued. "You can't expect people to have
their lawns inoculated if they find out it's going to make grass
act this way."</p>

<p>Her eyes might have been microscopes and I something
smeared on a slide. "Weener, youre the sort of man who peddles
<i>Life Begins at Forty</i> to the inmates of an old peoples'
home."</p>

<p>I couldnt see what had upset her. The last idea had sound
salesappeal, but it was a low income market.... Oh well&mdash;her
queer notions and obscure reactions undoubtedly went<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
with her scientific gift. You have to lead individuals of this type
for their own good, otherwise they spend their lives wandering
around in a dreamy fog, accomplishing nothing.</p>

<p>"I still believe youve got something," I pointed out. "You
yourself said it wasnt perfected, but perhaps you havent realized
how far from marketable it actually is yet. Now then," I
went on reasonably, "youre just going to have to dilute it or
change it or do something to it, so while it will make grass nice
and green, it won't let it grow wild like this."</p>

<p>The fixed look could be annoying. It was nearly impossible
to turn your eyes away without rudeness once she caught them.
"Weener, the Metamorphizer is neither fertilizer nor plant
food. It is a chemical compound producing a controlled mutation
in any treated member of the family Gramineae. Dilution
might make it not work&mdash;the mutation might not take place&mdash;but
it couldnt make it half work. I could change your nature
by forcibly injecting an ounce of lead into your cerebellum.
The change would not only be irrevocable, but it wouldnt
make the slightest difference if the lead were adulterated with
ironpyrites or not."</p>

<p>"But, Miss Francis," I expostulated, "you'll have to do
<i>something</i>."</p>

<p>She threw her hands into the air, a theatrical gesture even
more than ordinarily unbecoming. "Why?"</p>

<p>"Why? To make your discovery marketable, of course."</p>

<p>"Now? In the face of this?"</p>

<p>"Miss Francis," I said with dignity, "you are a lady and my
selfrespect makes me treat you with the courtesy due your sex.
You advertised for a salesman. Instead of sneering at my honest
efforts to put your merchandise across to the public, I think
youd be better advised to worry about such lowbrow things as
keeping faith."</p>

<p>"Am I to keep faith in a vacuum? You came to me as a salesman
and I must give you something to sell. This is simple
morality; but if such a grant entails concomitant evils, surely
I am absolved of my original contract."</p>

<p>"I don't know what youre talking about," I told her frankly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
"Your stuff made the grass grow too fast, that's all. You should
change the formula or find a new one or else ..."</p>

<p>"Or else youll have been left with nothing to sell. I despair
of making the point about changing the formula; your trust
in my powers is too reverent. Again, I'm not an arrogant
woman and I'll admit to some responsibility. Make the world
fit for Alfred Weener to make a living in."</p>

<p>"It's Albert, not Alfred," I corrected her. I'm not touchy,
goodness knows, but afterall a name's a piece of property.</p>

<p>"Your pardon, Albert." She looked down at me with such a
placatory and genuinely feminine smile I decided I'd been
foolish to be offended. She's a nut of course, I thought indulgently,
someone whose life is bounded by theories and testtubes,
a woman with no conception of practical reality. Instead
of being affronted it would be better to show her patiently how
essential my help was to her.</p>

<p>"Of all people," she went on, searching my face with those
discomfiting eyes, "of all people Ive the least cause for moral
snobbery. Anxious to get a few dollars to carry on my work&mdash;and
what was such anxiety but selfindulgence?&mdash;I threw the
Metamorphizer to you and the world before I realized that it
was not only imperfect, but faulty. Hell is paved with good intentions
and the first result of my desire to benefit mankind
has been to injure the Dinkmans. Meditation in place of infatuation
would have shown me both the immediate and ultimate
wrongs. I doubt if youd been gone an hour yesterday when I
knew I'd made a blunder in permitting you to go out with
danger in both hands."</p>

<p>"I don't know what youre getting at," I said stiffly, for it
sounded as though she were regarding me as a child.</p>

<p>"Why, as I was sitting, composing my thoughts toward extending
the effectiveness of the Metamorphizer beyond gramina,
it suddenly became clear to me I'd erred about not
knowing how long the effect of the inoculations would last."</p>

<p>"You mean you found out?" If she brought the thing under
control and the effect lasted a specified time there might be
repeat business afterall.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>"I found out a great deal by using speculation and logic for
a change instead of my hands and memory. I sat and thought,
and though this is an unorthodox way for a scientist to proceed,
I profited by it. I reasoned: if you change the genetic structure
of a plant you change it permanently; not for a day or an hour,
but for its existence. I'm not speaking of chance mutations, you
understand, Weener, coming about over a course of generations,
generations which include sports, degenerates, atavars
andsoforth; but of controlled changes, brought about through
human intervention. Inoculation by the Metamorphizer might
be compared to cutting off a man's leg or transplanting part of
his brain. Albert&mdash;what happens when you cut off a man's leg?"</p>

<p>I was tired of being talked to like a grammarschool class.
Still, I humored her. "Why, then he has only one leg," I answered
agreeably if idiotically.</p>

<p>"True. More than that, he has a onelegged disposition. His
whole ego, his entire spirit is changed. No longer a twolegged
creature, reduced, he is another&mdash;warped, if you like&mdash;being.
To come to the immediate point of the grass: if you engender
an omnivorous capacity you implant an insatiable appetite."</p>

<p>"I don't catch."</p>

<p>"If you give a man a big belly you make him a hog."</p>

<p>A chevvy coupe, gently breathing steam from its radiator
cap, interrupted. From its turtle hung the blade of a scythe and
on the nervously hinged door had been hopefully lettered
<i>Arcangelo Barelli, Plowing &amp; Grading</i>.</p>

<p>While the coupe was trembling for some seconds before
quieting down, I sighed a double relief, at Miss Francis' forgetfulness
of the money due her and the soothing of my fears
for the lawn's eating its way downward to China or India. The
remark about gluttonous abdomens was disturbing.</p>

<p>"And of course there will be no further sale of the Metamorphizer,"
she concluded, her eyes now totally concerned
with the farmer who was opening the turtle with the air of a
man expecting to be unpleasantly astonished.</p>

<p>Mr Barelli came as to a deathbed, a consoling but hopeless
smile widening his narrow face only inconsiderably. At the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
scythe cradled in his arms someone shouted, "Here's old Father
Time himself." Mr Barelli wasnt amused. Brushing his forehead
thoughtfully with tender fingers he surveyed with saddened
eye the three graduated steps of grass. The last step,
unessayed by his predecessors, rose nearly four feet, as alien to
the concept of lawn as a field of wheat.</p>

<p>"Think you can cut it?" one of the audience asked.</p>

<p>Mr Barelli smiled cheerlessly and didnt answer. Instead, he
uprooted from his hip pocket a slender stone and began phlegmatically
to caress the blade of the scythe with it.</p>

<p>"Hay, that stuff's not goin to stop growin while you fool
around."</p>

<p>"Got to do things right," explained Mr Barelli gently.</p>

<p>The rhythmic friction of stone against steel prolonged suspense
unbearably. All kinds of speculation crowded my mind
while the leisurely performance went on. The grass was growing
rapidly; faster than vegetation had ever grown before.
Could it grow so quickly the farmer's scythe couldnt keep up
with it? Suppose it had been wheat or corn? Planted today, it
would be ready to harvest next week, fully ripe. The original
dream of Miss Francis would pale compared with the reality.
There was still&mdash;somewhere, somehow&mdash;a fortune in the Metamorphizer....</p>

<p>Ready at last, Mr Barelli walked delicately across the stubble
as if it were a substance too precious to be trampled brutally.
Again he measured the rippling, ascending mass with his eye.
It was the look of a bridegroom.</p>

<p>"What you waitin for?"</p>

<p>Unheeding, he scraped bootwelt semicircularly on the sward
as though to mark a stance. Once more he appraised the grass,
crooked his knee, rested his hands lightly on the two short,
upraised handholds. Satisfied at length with his preparations,
he finally drew the scythe back with a sweeping motion of both
arms and curved it forward close to the ground. It embraced
a sudden island lovingly and a sheaf of grass swooned into a
heap. I was reminded of old woodcuts in a history of the
French Revolution.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>The bystanders sighed in harmony. "Nothing to it ... should
a had him in the first place ... can't beat the old
elbowgrease. No, sir, musclepower'll do it every time ... guess
it's licked now all right, all right...." Mr Barelli duplicated
his sweep and another sheaf fell. Another. And another....</p>

<p>"One of the oldest human rituals," remarked Miss Francis,
swaying her body in time with the farmer's. "An act of devotion
to Ceres. But all this husbandman reaps is <i>Cynodon dactylon</i>.
A commentary."</p>

<p>"Progress," I pointed out. "Now they have machines to harvest
grain. All uptodate farmers use them; only the backward
ones stick to primitive tools and have to make a living by taking
on odd jobs."</p>

<p>"Progress," she repeated, looking from the scythewielder to
me and back again. "Progress, Weener. A remarkable conception
of the nineteenth century...."</p>

<p>The less intense spectators began to move off; not, to be sure,
without backward glances, but the metronomic swing of Mr
Barelli's blade indicated it was all over with the rank grass now.
I too should have been on my way, writing off the Metamorphizer
as a total loss and considering methods for making a
new and more profitable connection. Not that I was one to
leave a sinking ship, nor had I lost faith in the potentialities of
Miss Francis' discovery; but she either wasnt smart enough to
modify her formula, or else ... but there really wasnt any
"or else". She just wasnt smart enough to make the Metamorphizer
marketable and she was cheating me of the handsome
return which should be rightfully mine.</p>

<p>She'd made the stuff and deceived me by an unscrupulously
worded advertisement, now, no longer interested, she asked
airily if further effort were essential. Who wouldnt be indignant?
And to cap it all she suddenly ejaculated, "Can't dawdle
around here all day" and after snatching up a handful of the
scythings, she left, rolling her large body from side to side,
galloping her untidy hair up and down over her neck as she
took rapid strides. Evidently the attractions of her messy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
kitchen were more to her taste than the wholesome air of outdoors.
Pottering around, producing another mare's nest and
eventually, I suppose, getting another victim....</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">7.</span> <span class="num2">B</span>ut I couldnt leave so cavalierly.
Every leaf, stem, and blade of the cancerous grass held me in
somewhat the same way Miss Francis' intense eyes did. It wasnt
an aesthetic or morbid attraction&mdash;its basis was strictly practical.
If it could have been controlled&mdash;if only the growth could
be induced on a modified and proper scale&mdash;what a product!
A fury of frustration rocked my customary calm....</p>

<p>The stretch and retraction of the mower's arms, the swift,
bright curving as the scythe cut deeper, fascinated me. An unscrupulous
man&mdash;just as a whimsical thought&mdash;might go about
in the night inoculating lawns surreptitiously and appear with
a crew next day to offer his services in cutting them. Just goes
to show how easy it is to make dishonest speculations ... but
of course such things don't pay in the long run....</p>

<p>The lush area was being reduced, but perhaps not with the
same rapidity as at first when Mr Barelli was at the top of
enthusiastic&mdash;if the adjective was applicable&mdash;vigor. Oftener
and oftener and oftener he paused to sharpen his implement
and I thought the cropped shocks were becoming smaller and
smaller. As the movement of the scythe swept the guillotined
grass backward, the trailing stolons entangled themselves with
the uncut stand, pulling the sheaves out of place and making
the stacks ragged and inadequate looking.</p>

<p>Behind me a cocky voice asked, "What's cooking around
here, chum?"</p>

<p>I turned round to a young man, thin as a bamboo pole, elegantly
tailored, who yawned to advertise gold inlays. I explained
while he looked skeptical, bored and knowing simultaneously.
"Who would tha flummox, bah goom?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Ay?"</p>

<p>He took a pack of playingcards from his pocket and riffled
them expertly. "Who you kidding, bud?" he translated.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>"No one. Ask anybody here if this wasnt a dead lawn yesterday
and if it hasnt grown this high since morning."</p>

<p>He yawned again and proffered me the deck. "Pick any
card," he suggested. To avoid rudeness I selected one. He put
the pack back and said, "You have the nine of diamonds.
Clever, eh?"</p>

<p>I didnt know whether it was or not. He accepted the
pasteboard from me and said, peering out from under furry
black eyebrows, "If I brought in a story like that, the chief
would fire me before you could say James Gordon Bennett."</p>

<p>"Youre a reporter?"</p>

<p>"Acute chap. Newspaperman. Name of Gootes. Jacson
Gootes, <i>Daily Intelligencer</i>, not <i>Thrilling Wonder Stories</i>."</p>

<p>I thought I saw an answer to my most pressing problem. One
has to stoop occasionally to methods which, if they didnt lead
to important ends, might almost be termed petty; but afterall
there was no reason Mr Jacson Gootes shouldnt buy me a dinner
in return for information valuable to him. "Let's get away
from here," I suggested.</p>

<p>He fished out a coin, showed it to me, waved his arm in the
air and opened an empty palm for my inspection. "Ah sho
would like to, cunnel, but Ahve got to covah thisyeah sto'y&mdash;even
if it's out of this mizzble wo'ld."</p>

<p>"I'm sure I can give you details to bring it down to earth,"
I told him. "Make it a story your editor will be glad to have."</p>

<p>"'Glad'!" He pressed tobacco into a slender pipe as emaciated
as himself. "You don't know W R. If he got a beat on the
story of Creation he'd be sore as hell because God wanted a
byline."</p>

<p>He evidently enjoyed his own quip for he repeated several
times in different accents "... God wanted a byline." He
puffed a matchflame and surveyed the field of Mr Barelli's
effort. "Hardworkin feller, what? Guess I better have a chat
with the bounder&mdash;probably closest to the dashed thing."</p>

<p>"Mr Gootes," I said impressively, "I am the man who applied
the inoculator to this grass. Now shall we get out of here
so you can listen to my story?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sonabeesh&mdash;thees gona be good. Lead away, amigo&mdash;I prepare
both ears to leesten."</p>

<p>I drew him toward Hollywood Boulevard and into a restaurant
I calculated might not be too expensive for his generosity.
Besides, he probably had an expenseaccount. We put a
porcelaintopped table between us and he commanded, "Give
down." Obediently I went over all the happenings of yesterday,
omitting only Miss Francis' name and the revealing wording
of the ad.</p>

<p>Gootes surveyed me interestedly. "You certainly started
something here, Acne and/or Psoriasis."</p>

<p>Humor like his was beneath offense. "My name's Albert
Weener."</p>

<p>"Mine's Mustard." He produced a plastic cup and rapidly
extracted from it a series of others in diminishing sizes. "I
wouldnt have thought it to look at you. The dirty deed, I
mean&mdash;not the exzemical hotdog. O K, Mister Weener&mdash;who's
this scientific magnate? Whyre you holding him out on me?"</p>

<p>"Scientists don't like to be disturbed in their researches,"
I temporized.</p>

<p>"No more does a man in a whorehouse," he retorted vulgarly.
"Story's no good without him."</p>

<p>That was what I thought and I'm afraid my satisfaction appeared
on my face.</p>

<p>"Now leely man&mdash;no try a hold up da press. Whatsa matter,
you aready had da beer and da roasta bif sanawich?"</p>

<p>"Maybe you better repeat the order. You know in these
cheap places they don't like to have you sit around and talk
without spending money."</p>

<p>"Money! Eh, laddie&mdash;I'm nae a millionaire." He balanced
a full glass of water thoughtfully upon a knifeblade, looking
around for applause. When it was not forthcoming he meekly
followed my suggestion.</p>

<p>"Listen, Gootes," I swallowed a mouthful of sandwich and
sipped a little beer. "I want to help you get your story."</p>

<p>He waved his hand and pulled a handkerchief out of his ear.</p>

<p>"The point is," I commenced, sopping a piece of bread in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
the thick gravy, "if I were to betray the confidence involved I
couldnt hope to continue my connection and I'd lose my
chances to benefit from this remarkable discovery."</p>

<p>"Balls," exclaimed Gootes. "Forget the spiel. I'm not a prospect
for your lawn tonic."</p>

<p>I disregarded the interruption. "I'm not a mercenary man
and I believe in enlightening the public to the fullest extent
compatible with decency. I'm willing to make a sacrifice for
the general good, yet I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"&mdash;'must live.' I know, I know. How much?"</p>

<p>"It seems to me fifty dollars would be little enough&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Fifty potatoes!" He went through an elaborate pantomime
of shock, horror, indignation, grotesque dismay and a dozen
other assorted emotions. "Little man, youre fruitcake sure.
W R wouldnt part with half a C for a tipoff on the Secondcoming.
No, brother&mdash;you rang the wrong bell. Five I might
get you&mdash;but no more."</p>

<p>I replied firmly I was not in need of charity&mdash;ignoring his
pointed look at the remains on my plate&mdash;and this was strictly
a business proposition, payment for value received. After some
bargaining he finally agreed to phone his managingeditor and
propose I'd "come clean" for twenty dollars. While he was on
this errand I added pie and coffee to the check. It is well to be
provident and I'd paid for my meal in more than money.</p>

<p>Jacson Gootes came limply from the phonebooth, his bumptiousness
gone. "No soap." He shook his head dejectedly. "Old
Man said only pity for the lower mammals prevented him from
letting me go to work for Hearst right away. Sorry."</p>

<p>His nerves appeared quite shattered; capable of restoration
only by Old Grandad. After tossing down a couple of bourbons
he seemed a little recovered, but hardly quite well enough to
use an accent or perform a trick.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry also," I said. "Since we can be of no further use
to each other&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't take a powder, chum," he urged plaintively. "What
about a last gander at the weed together?"</p>

<p>As we walked back I reflected that at any rate I was saved<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
from submitting Miss Francis to vulgar publicity. Everything
is for the best&mdash;Ive seen a hundred instances to prove it. Perhaps&mdash;who
knew&mdash;something might yet happen to make it possible
for me to profit by the freak growth.</p>

<p>"Needs a transfusion," remarked Gootes as we stood on the
sidewalk before it.</p>

<p>Indeed it was anemically green; uneven, hacked and ragged;
shorn of its emerald beauty. A high fog filtered the late afternoon
light to show Mr Barelli's task accomplished and the curious
watchers gone. It was no smoothly clipped carpet, yet it was
no longer a freakish, exotic thing. Rather forlorn it looked,
and crippled.</p>

<p>"Paleface pay out much wampum to get um cut every day."</p>

<p>"Oh, it probably won't take long till the strength is exhausted."</p>

<p>"Says you. Well, Ive got half a story. Cheerio."</p>

<p>I sighed. If only Miss Francis could control it. A fortune ...</p>

<p>I walked home, trying to figure out what I was going to do
tomorrow.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">8.</span> <span class="num2">I</span> thought I was prepared for anything
after the shocks of the day before; I know I was prepared
for nothing at all&mdash;to find the grass as I'd left it or even reverted
to its original decay. Indeed, I was not too sure that my memory
was completely accurate; that the thing had happened so
fantastically.</p>

<p>But the devilgrass had outdone itself and made my anticipations
foolish. It waved a green crest higher than the crowd&mdash;a
crowd three times the size of yesterday's and increasing rapidly.
All the scars inflicted on it, the indignities of scythe and
mower, were covered by a new and even more prodigious stand
which made all its former growth appear puny. Bold and insolent,
it had repaired the hackedout areas and risen to such a
height that, except for a narrow strip at the top, all the windows
of the Dinkman house were smothered. Of the garage, only the
roof, islanded and bewildered, was visible, apparently resting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
on a solid foundation of devilgrass. It sprawled kittenishly, its
deceptive softness faintly suggesting fur; at once playful and
destructive. My optimism of the night before was dashed; this
voracious growth wasnt going to dwindle away of itself. It
would have to be killed, rooted out.</p>

<p>Now the Dinkman lawn wasnt continuous with its neighbors,
but, until now, had been set off by chesthigh hedges. The
day before these had contained and defined the growth, but,
overwhelming them in the night, the grass had swept across and
invaded the neat, civilized plots behind, blurring sharply cut
edges, curiously investigating flowerbeds, barbarously strangling
shapely bushes.</p>

<p>But these werent the ravages which upset me; it was reasonable
if not entirely comfortable to see shrubbery, plants and
blossoms swallowed up. Work of men's hands they may be, but
they bear the imprimatur of nature. The cement sidewalk,
however, was pure artifice, stamped with the trademark of
man. Indignity and defeat were symbolized by its overrunning;
it was an arrogant defiance, an outrageous challenge offered to
every man happening by. But the grass was not satisfied with
this irreverence: it was already making demands on curbing
and gutter.</p>

<p>"Junior, youve got a story now. W R fired three copyboys
and a proofreader he was so mad at himself. Here." Jacson
Gootes made a pass in the air, simulated astonishment at the
twentydollar bill which appeared miraculously between his
fingers and put it in my hand.</p>

<p>"Thank you," I replied coolly. "Just what is this for?"</p>

<p>"Faith, me boy, such innocence Ive never seen since I left
the old sod. Tis but a little token of esteem from himself, to
repay you for the trouble of leading me to your scientist, your
Frankenstein, your Burbank. Lead on, my boy. And make it
snappy, brother," he added, "because Ive got to be back here
for the rescue."</p>

<p>"Rescue?"</p>

<p>"Yeah. People in the house." He consulted a scrap of paper.
"Pinkman&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dinkman."</p>

<p>"Dinkman. Yeah&mdash;thanks&mdash;no idea how sensitive people are
when you get their names wrong. Dinkmans phoned the firedepartment.
Can't get out. Rescue any minute&mdash;got to cover
that&mdash;imperative&mdash;TRAPPED IN HOME BY FREAK LAWN&mdash;and
nail down your scientist at the same time."</p>

<p>I was very anxious myself to see what would happen here so
I suggested, since I could take him to the discoverer of the
Metamorphizer any time, that we'd better stay and get the
Dinkman story first. With overenthusiastic praise of my acuteness,
he agreed and began practicing his sleightofhand tricks to
the great pleasure of some children, the same ones, I suspect,
who had plagued me when I was spraying the lawn.</p>

<p>His performance was terminated by the rapidly approaching
firesiren. The crowd seemed of several minds about the purpose
of the red truck squealing around the corner to a stop.
Some, like Gootes, had heard the Dinkmans were indeed
trapped in the house; others declared the firemen had come to
cut away the grass onceandforall; still others held the loud
opinion that the swift growth had generated a spontaneous
combustion.</p>

<p>But having made their abrupt face-in-the-ground halt, the
truck (or rather the firemen on it) anticlimactically did nothing
at all. Helmeted and accoutered, ready for instant action,
they relaxed contentedly against the engine, oblivious of grass,
bystanders, or presumable emergency. Gootes strolled over to
inquire the cause of their indolence. "Waiting for the chief,"
he was informed. Thereupon he borrowed a helmet (possibly
on the strength of his presscard) and proceeded to pull from it
such a variety of objects that he received the final accolade
from several of his audience when they told him admiringly
he ought to be on the stage.</p>

<p>The bystanders were not seduced by this entertainment into
approval of the firemen's idleness and inquired sarcastically
why they had left their cots behind or if they thought they were
still on WPA? The men remained impervious until the chief<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
jumped out of his red roadster and surveyed the scene napoleonically.
"Thought somebody was pulling a rib," he explained
to no one in particular. "All right, boys, there's folks in that
house&mdash;let's get them out."</p>

<p>Carrying a ladder the men plunged toward the house. Their
boots trod the sprawling runners heavily, spurning and crushing
them carelessly. The grass responded by flowing back like
water, sloshing over ankles and lapping at calves, thoroughly
entangling and impeding progress. Panting and struggling the
firemen penetrated only a short way into the mass before they
were slowed almost to a standstill. From the sidelines it seemed
as though they were wrestling with an invisible octopus. Feet
were lifted high, but never free of the twining vegetation; the
ladder was pulled angrily forward, but the clutch of the grass
upon it became firmer with every tug.</p>

<p>At length they were halted, although their efforts still gave
an appearance of advance. Thrashing and wrenching they
urged themselves and the now burdensome ladder against the
invincible wall. The only result was to give the illusion they
were burying themselves in the clutching tentacles. Exertions
dwindled; the struggle grew less intense; then they retreated,
fighting their way out of the enveloping mass in a panic of
desperation, abandoning the ladder.</p>

<p>The chief surveyed them with less than approbation. "Cut
your way in," he ordered. "You guys think those axes are only
to bust up furniture with?"</p>

<p>Obediently, wedges of bright steel flashed against the green
wall.</p>

<p>"Impatiently I await the rescue of fair Dinkmans from this
enchanted keep," murmured Gootes, vainly trying to balance
his pipe on the back of his hand.</p>

<p>It looked as though he would have to contain his impatience
for some time. The firemen slashed unenthusiastically at the
grass, which gave way only grudgingly and by inches. Halfanhour
later they triumphantly dragged out the abandoned ladder.
"Stuff's like rubber&mdash;bounds back instead of cutting."</p>

<p>"Yeah. And in the meantime those people been telephoning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
again. Want to know what the delay is. Want to know what
they pay taxes for. Threaten to sue the city."</p>

<p>"Let'm sue. Long as theyre in there they can't collect."</p>

<p>"Funny as a flat tire. Get going, goldbrick."</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">9.</span> <span class="num2">A</span>nother firetruck rolled up and
there was much kidding back and forth between the two crews.
This was clearly no situation in which lives or property were
at stake; it was rather in line with assisting distraught cats down
from tops of telephonepoles or persuading selfimmolated children
to unlock the bathroom door and let mommy in; an amusing
interval in a tense day. Perhaps those manning the second
truck were more naturally ingenious, possibly the original
workers sought more diverting labor; at any rate the futile
chopping was abandoned. Instead, several long ladders were
hooked together and the synthesis lowered from the curb to
the edge of Dinkman's roof. It seemed remarkably fragile, but
it reached and the watchers murmured approval.</p>

<p>No longer beset by novelty, the men took easily to the swaying,
sagging bridge. They passed over the baffled grass, the
leader carrying another short ladder which he hung from the
roof, stabbing its lower rungs down into the matted verdure
below. The crossing was made with such insouciance the wonder
was they hadnt done it at first, instead of wasting time on
other expedients.</p>

<p>The firemen went down the vertical ladder and forced an
entrance into the choked windows. Mrs Dinkman came out
first, helped by two of them. She kept pinching her glasses into
place with one hand and pulling her skirt modestly close with
the other, activities leaving her very little to grasp the ladder
with. The firemen seemed quite accustomed to this sort of irrationality,
and paying no heed to the rush of words&mdash;inaudible
to us on the street&mdash;bursting from her, they coaxed her expertly
up onto the roof. Here she stood, statuesquely outlined against
the bright sky, berating her succorers, until Mr Dinkman,
rounded, bald, and calm, joined her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>At first Mrs Dinkman refused to try the bridge to the street,
but after some urging which was conveyed to us by the gestures
of the firemen, she ventured gingerly on the trembling ladders
only to draw back quickly. One of the firemen demonstrated
the ease and simplicity of the journey, but it was vain; Mrs
Dinkman was carried across gallantly in traditional movie style,
with Mr Dinkman and the crew following sedately behind.</p>

<p>"A crime," Mrs Dinkman was saying when she came within
earshot. "A crime. Malicious mischief. Ought to be locked up
for life."</p>

<p>"Don't upset yourself, my dear," urged Mr Dinkman. "It's
very distressing, but afterall it might be worse."</p>

<p>"'Worse'! Adam Dinkman, has misfortune completely unhinged
your mind? Money thrown in the gutter&mdash;imposed on
by oily rascals&mdash;our house swallowed up by this ... this unnatural
stuff&mdash;and the final humiliation of being pulled out of
our own home in front of a gawking crowd." She turned
around and shouted, "Shoo, shoo&mdash;why don't you go home?"
And then to Mr Dinkman again, "'Worse' indeed! I'd like to
know what could be worse?"</p>

<p>"Well now&mdash;" began Mr Dinkman; but I didnt hear the rest,
for I was afraid by "rascals" Mrs Dinkman referred, quite unjustly,
to me and I thought the time opportune to remind
Gootes he hadnt yet completed his assignment.</p>

<p>"Right," he agreed, suddenly assuming the abrupt accents
of an improbable Englishman, "oh very right, old chap. Let's
toddle along and see what Fu Manchu has to say for himself.
First off though I shall have to phone in to Fleet Street&mdash;I mean
to W R."</p>

<p>"Fine. You can ask him at the same time to authorize you
to give me the other thirty."</p>

<p>Gootes lost his British speech instantly. "What other thirty,
bum?"</p>

<p>"Why, the balance of the fifty. For an introduction to Mi&mdash;to
the maker of the Metamorphizer. To compensate me, you
know, for my loss of revenue."</p>

<p>"Weener, you have all the earmarks of a castiron moocher.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Let me tell you, suh&mdash;such methods are unbecoming. They
suggest damyankee push and blackmail. Remember Reconstruction
and White Supremacy, suh."</p>

<p>If I were hypersensitive to the silly things people say, I
should have given up selling long before. I pretended not to
hear him. We walked into a drugstore and he dropped a nickel
into a payphone, hunching the receiver between ear and shoulder.
"Fifty your last word?" he asked out of the corner of his
mouth.</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>"Hello? <i>'Gencer?</i> Gootes. Hya, beautiful? Syphilis all
cleared up? Now ... now, baby ... well, if youre going to
be formal&mdash;gimme W R." He turned to me and leered while
he waited.</p>

<p>"... Chief? Gootes. Got the Dinkman story. You know&mdash;Freak
Growth Swallows Hollywood Mansion. Yeah. Yeah. I
know. But, Chief&mdash;this was what I wanted you for&mdash;on the followup;
I have the fellow who put the stuff on the grass. Yeah.
Sure I did. Yeah. And the sonofabitch wants to hold us up for
another thirty. Or else he won't sing. Yeah. Yeah. I know. But
I can't, Chief. I havent got a lead. I don't know, Chief, not
much of a one, I guess. Wait a minute."</p>

<p>He turned to me. "Listen, little man: Mr Le ffa&ccedil;as&eacute;"&mdash;he
pronounced it l'fassassy and he pronounced it with awe. I too
was properly solemn, for I hadnt realized before to whom he
referred when he talked so lightly of "W R." I knew&mdash;as what
newspaper reader didnt&mdash;of William Rufus Le ffa&ccedil;as&eacute;, "The
Last of the Great Editors," but I hadnt connected him with the
<i>Daily Intelligencer</i>&mdash; "&mdash;Mr Le ffa&ccedil;as&eacute; will shoot you another
sawbuck and no more. What's the deal?"</p>

<p>Now, the famous editor's reputation was such that you didnt
tell him to go to the devil, even through the medium of an
agent; it would have been like writing your name on the Lincoln
Memorial. It was reluctantly therefore that I shook my
head. "I'm sorry, Mr Gootes," I apologized, "I'd certainly like
to oblige&mdash;"</p>

<p>He cut me off with a waving hand and turned cheerfully<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
back to the telephone. "No soap, Chief. O K. O K. All right&mdash;put
the rewrite man on." And for the next ten minutes he
went over the events at the Dinkmans', carefully spelling out
all names including the napoleonic firechief's. I began to suspect
Gootes wasnt so inefficient a reporter as he appeared.</p>

<p>The story given in, he hung up and turned to me. "Well, so
long, little man&mdash;been nice knowing you."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;what about meeting the discoverer of the Metamorphizer?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that. Well, W R thinks we don't need him anymore.
Not enough in that angle."</p>

<p>I suspected he was bluffing; still it was possible he wasnt. In
such a delicate situation there was nothing I could do but bluff
in turn. If you are a good salesman, I always say, you must have
psychology at your fingertips. "Very well, Mr Gootes; perhaps
I shall see you again sometime."</p>

<p>I was immediately confronted by a Frenchman, affable, volatile,
affectionate. "Ah cher ami, do not leave me with the
abruptness. You desolate mon coeur. Alors&mdash;return to me the
twenty dollars."</p>

<p>"But, Mr Gootes&mdash;"</p>

<p>"None of it, bud." He whisked the cards out and showed
them to me, the ace of spades ghoulishly visible, its ominousness
tempered only by the word "Bicycle" printed across it.
"Don't hold out on your Uncle Jacson or I might have the boys
take you for a little trip. A block of concrete tastefully inscribed
'A Weener' ought to make an amusing base for a birdbath, say."</p>

<p>"Listen, Gootes." I was firm. "I'm reasonably certain youve
been authorized to advance me the other thirty, but I hope
we're both sensible people and I'll be glad to sign a receipt for
the full amount if youll let me have twentyfive."</p>

<p>"Albert, youre a fine fellow&mdash;a prince." On a page from his
notebook he wrote, <i>Of Jacson Gootes, $50 U.S.</i> and I signed it.
He handed me another twentydollarbill and put his wallet
away. "Charge the other five to agent's fees," he suggested.
"Lead us to your Steinmetz."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>You just can't expect everyone to have the same standards
of probity, so philosophically I pocketed my loss and gains together.
Life is full of ups and downs and take the bad with the
good. Gootes was in high spirits after his piece of chicanery and
as we went down the street he practiced, quite unsuccessfully,
a series of ventriloquial exercises.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">10.</span> <span class="num2">T</span>he appearance of the apartmenthouse
drew the comment from him that it was a good thing for
their collective bloodpressures the Chamber of Commerce and
the All Year Club didnt know such things existed in the heart
of Hollywood. "It's no better than I live in myself," he added.</p>

<p>He whistled at the dismal livingroom and raised his eyebrows
at the kitchen. Before I could mutter an introduction,
Miss Francis growled without turning around, "If youve come
about the icebox&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Zounds!" exclaimed Gootes. "A female Linnaeus. Shades
of Dorothy Dix!"</p>

<p>"I don't know who you are, young man, but youre extremely
impudent to come tramping into my kitchen, adding nothing
to the sum of knowledge but a confirmation of my sex which
would be plain to any mammal. If youve&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nein, Fr&auml;ulein Doktor," said Gootes hastily, "about z' kelvinators
I know nossing. I represent, Fr&auml;ulein Doktor, z' <i>Daily
Intelligencer</i> zeitung&mdash;"</p>

<p>Miss Francis pierced his turgid explanation with a sharp
spate of words in what I took to be German. Gootes answered
with difficult slowness, but he fumbled and halted before long
and abandoning the Central European, became again the
Southern Gentleman. "I quite understand, mam, how any
delicately reared gentlewoman would resent having her privacy
intruded upon by rude agents of the yellow press. But
consider, mam: we live in a progressive age and having made a
great contribution to Science you can hardly escape the fame
rightfully yours. You are a public figure now and must stand
in the light. Would it not be preferable, mam, to talk as lady<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
to gentleman (I am related to the Taliaferros of Ruffin County
on the distaff side) than to be badgered by some hack journalist?"</p>

<p>Miss Francis squatted ungracefully on her heels and looked
up from the flowerpot she had been engaged with. "I havent
any objection to publicity, hack or otherwise," she said mildly.
"I am merely impressed again by the invulnerability of newspapers
to thousands of important discoveries and inventions,
newsworthy 'contributions to Science' as you call them in your
bland ignorance of semantics, in contrast to their acute, almost
painful sensitivity to any mischance."</p>

<p>Gootes, unjointing disproportioned length carelessly against
the sink to the peril of several jars of specimens, didnt reply.
Instead he fluttered his arms and produced a halfdollar, apparently
from Miss Francis' hair, which after exhibiting he
prudently pocketed.</p>

<p>"Tell me, Dr Francis&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Miss. Show me how you did that trick."</p>

<p>"In a minute, Miss Francis. It's a honey, isnt it? Paid fourbits
to a funhouse in Utica, New York, for it. Tell me, how did you
come to make your great discovery?"</p>

<p>"I was born. I went to school. I read books. I reached maturity.
I looked through a microscope."</p>

<p>"Yes?" prodded Gootes.</p>

<p>"That's all."</p>

<p>"Lassie," urged Gootes, underlining the honey of his voice
with a tantalizing glimpse of a rapidfire snatching of three colored
handkerchiefs out of the air, "tis no sensible course ye
follow. Think, gurrl, what the press can do to a recalcitrant
lass like yoursel. Ye wouldna like it if tomorrow's paper
branded you&mdash;and I quote&mdash;'an unsexed harpy, a traitor to
mankind, a heartless, soulless&mdash;'"</p>

<p>"Oh, shut up. What do you want to know?"</p>

<p>"First," said Gootes briskly, "what is this stuff?"</p>

<p>"The Metamorphizer?"</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"You want the chemical formula?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wouldnt do me or my readers the least bit of good and you
wouldnt give it to me if I asked. Why should you? No, enlighten
me in English."</p>

<p>"It is a compound on the order of colchicine, acting through
the somaplasm of the plant. It is apparently effective only on
the family Gramineae, producing a constitutional metabolic
change. I have no means of knowing as yet whether this change
is transmissible through seed to offspring&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hay, wait a minute. 'Producing a constitutional metabolic
change.' How do you spell metabolic&mdash;never mind, the proofreaders'll
catch it. What constitutional change?"</p>

<p>"Are you a botanist, young man?" Gootes shook his head.
"An agrostologist? Even an agronomist? Then you can't have
the slightest idea what I'm talking about."</p>

<p>"Maybe not," retorted Gootes, "but one of my readers
might. Just give me a rough idea."</p>

<p>"Plants absorb certain minerals in suspension. That is, they
absorb some and reject others. The Metamorphizer seems to
give them the ability to break down even the most stable compound,
select what they need, and also fix the inert nitrogen of
the air to nourish themselves."</p>

<p>"'Themselves,'" repeated Gootes, writing rapidly. "O K. If
I get you&mdash;which is doubtful&mdash;so far it sounds just like a good
new fertilizer."</p>

<p>"Really? I tried to make myself clear."</p>

<p>"Now don't get sore, Professor. Just give out on what made
the grass go wild."</p>

<p>"I can only hazard a guess. As I told Weener, if you create a
capacity, you engender an appetite. I imagine that patch of
<i>Cynodon dactylon</i> just couldnt stop absorbing once it had been
inoculated."</p>

<p>"Aha. Like giving a man a taste for bourbon."</p>

<p>"If it pleases you to put it that way."</p>

<p>"O K. O K. Now let's have an idea how this growth can
be stopped. Theoretical, you know."</p>

<p>"As far as I know," said Miss Francis, "it cannot be stopped."</p>

<h3>Consequences of a Discovery</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">11.</span> <span class="num2">"B</span>ut it's got to be stopped," exclaimed
Gootes.</p>

<p>Miss Francis turned silently back to her flowerpot as though
she'd forgotten us. Gootes coursed the kitchenfloor like a puzzled
yet anxious hound. "Damn it, it's got to be stopped." He
halfway extracted his pack of cards, then hastily withdrew his
hand as though guarding the moment's gravity.</p>

<p>"Otherwise ... why, otherwise itll swallow the house."
He decided on the cards afterall and balanced four of them
edgewise on the back of his hand. Miss Francis immediately
abandoned the flowerpot to stare childishly at the feat. "In
fact, if what you say is true, it will literally swallow up the
house. Digest it. Convert it into devilgrass."</p>

<p>"<i>Cynodon dactylon.</i> What I say is true. How much elementary
physics is involved in that trick?"</p>

<p>"But that's terrible," protested Gootes. He regarded a bowl
of algae as if about to make it disappear. Mentally I agreed;
one of the greatest potential moneymakers of the age lost and
valueless.</p>

<p>"Yes," she agreed, "it is terrible. Terrible as the starvation
in a hive when the apiarist takes out the winter honey; terrible
as the daily business in an abattoir; terrible as the appetite of
grown fish at spawning time."</p>

<p>"Poo. Fate. Kismet. Nature."</p>

<p>"Ah; you are unconcerned with catastrophes which don't
affect man."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>"Local man," substituted Gootes. "Los Angeles man. <i>Pithecanthropus
moviensis.</i> Stiffs in Constantinople are strictly AP
stuff."</p>

<p>"It seems to me," I broke in, "that you are both assuming too
much. I don't know of anything that calls for the word catastrophe.
I'm sure I'm sorry if the Dinkmans' house is swallowed
up as Gootes suggests, but it hasnt been and I'm sure the possibility
is exaggerated. The authorities will do something or the
grass will stop growing. I don't see any point in looking at the
blackest side of things."</p>

<p>Gootes opened his mouth in pretended astonishment. "Wal,
I swan. Boy's a philosopher."</p>

<p>"You are not particularly concerned, Weener?"</p>

<p>"I don't know any reason why I should be," I retorted. "I
sold your product in good faith and I am not responsible&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, blind, blind. Do you imagine one man can suffer and
you not suffer? Is your name Simeon Stylites? Do you think for
an instant what happens to any man doesnt happen to everyman?
Are you not your brother's keeper?" She twisted her
hands together. "Not responsible! Why, you are responsible
for every brutality, execution, meanness and calamity in the
world today!"</p>

<p>I had often heard that the borderline between profundity
and insanity was thin and inexact and it was now clear on
which side she stood. I looked at Gootes to see how he was
taking her hysterical outburst, but he had found a batch of
empty testtubes which he was building into a perilously swaying structure.</p>

<p>"Of course, of course," I agreed soothingly, backing away.
"Youre quite right."</p>

<p>She walked the floor as if her awkward body were a burden.
"Is the instant response to an obvious truth&mdash;platitude even&mdash;always
a diagnosis of lunacy? I state a thought so old no one
knows who first expressed it and a hearer feels bound to choose
between offense to himself and contempt for the speaker. Believe
me, Weener, I was offering no exclusive indictment: I too
am guilty&mdash;infinitely culpable. Even if I had devoted my life to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
pure science&mdash;perhaps even more certainly then&mdash;patterning
myself on a medieval monastic, faithful to vows of poverty and
singleness of purpose; even if I had not, for an apparently laudable
end, betrayed my efforts to a base greed; even if I had
never picked for a moment's use such an unworthy&mdash;do not be
insulted again, Weener, unworthiness is a fact, insofar as there
are any facts at all&mdash;such an unworthy tool as yourself; even if
I had never compounded the Metamorphizer; even if I had
been a biologist or an astronomer&mdash;even then I should be guilty
of ruining the Dinkmans and making them homeless, just as
you are guilty and the reporter here is guilty and the garbageman
is guilty and the pastor in his pulpit is guilty."</p>

<p>"Guilty," exclaimed Gootes suddenly, "guilty! What kind of
a lousy newspaperman am I? Worrying about guilt and solutions
in the face of impending calamity instead of serving it
redhot to a palpitating public. Guilty&mdash;hell, I ought to be fired.
Or anyway shot. Where's the phone?"</p>

<p>"I manage a minimum of privacy in spite of inquiring reporters
and unemployed canvassers. I have no telephone."</p>

<p>"Hokay. Hole everythings. I return immediate."</p>

<p>I followed him for I had no desire to be left alone with someone
who might prove dangerous. But his long legs took him
quickly out of sight before I could catch him, even by running,
and so I fell into a more sedate pace. All Miss Francis' metaphysical
talk was beyond me, but what little I could make of it
was pure nonsense. Guilty. Why, I had never done anything
illegal in my life, unless taking a glass of beer in dry territory
be so accounted. All this talk about guilt suggested some sort
of inverted delusions of persecution. How sad it was the eccentricity
of genius so often turned its possessors into cranks. I
was thankful to be of mere normal intelligence.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">12.</span> <span class="num2">B</span>ut I wasted no more thought on her,
putting the whole episode of the Metamorphizer behind me,
for I now had some liquid capital. It was true it didnt amount
to much, but it existed, crinkled in my pocket, and I was sure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
with my experience and native ability I could turn the <i>Daily
Intelligencer</i>'s forty dollars into a much larger sum.</p>

<p>But a resolve to forget the Metamorphizer didnt enable me
to escape Mrs Dinkman's lawn. Walking down Hollywood
Boulevard, formulating, rejecting and reshaping plans for my
future, I passed a radioshop and from a loudspeaker hung over
the door with the evident purpose of inducing suggestible
pedestrians to rush in and purchase sets, the latest report of the
devilgrass's advance was blared out at me.</p>

<p>"... Station KPAR, The Voice of Edendale, reaching you
from a portable transmitter located in the street in front of
what was formerly the residence of Mr and Mrs Dinkman. I
guess youve all heard the story of how their lawn was allegedly
sprinkled with some chemical which made the grass run wild.
I don't know anything about that, but I want to tell you this
grass is certainly running wild. It must be fifteen or sixteen
feet high&mdash;think of that, folks&mdash;nearly as high as three men
standing on each other's shoulders. It's covered the roof halfway
to the peak and it's choking the windows and doorways of
the houses on either side. It's all over the sidewalk&mdash;looks like
an enormous green woolly rug&mdash;no, that's not quite right&mdash;anyway,
it's all over the sidewalk and it would be right out here in
the street where I'm talking to you from if the firedepartment
wasnt on the job constantly chopping off the creeping ends as
they come over the curb. I want to tell you, folks, it's a frightening
sight to see grass&mdash;the same kind of grass growing in your
backyard or mine&mdash;magnified or maybe I mean multiplied a
hundred times&mdash;or maybe more&mdash;and coming at you as if it was
an enemy&mdash;only the cold steel of the fireman's ax saving you
from it.</p>

<p>"While we're waiting for some action, folks&mdash;well, not exactly
that&mdash;the grass is giving us plenty of action all right&mdash;I'll
try to bring you some impressions of the people in the street.
Literally in the street, because the sidewalk is covered with
grass. Pardon me, sir&mdash;would you like to say a few words to the
unseen audience of Station KPAR? Speak right into the microphone,
sir. Let's have your name first. Don't be bashful. Haha.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
Gentleman doesnt care to give his name. Well, that's all right,
quite all right. Just what do you think of this phenomenon?
How does it impress you? Are you disturbed by the sight of this
riot of vegetation? Right into the microphone...."</p>

<p>"Uh ... hello ... well, I guess I havent ... uh anything
much to say ... pretty color ... bad stuff, I guess.
Gladsnotgrowing myyard...."</p>

<p>"Yes, go right on, sir. Oh ... the gentleman is through.
Very interesting and thank you.</p>

<p>"Theyre bringing up a whole crew of weedburners now&mdash;going
to try and get this thing under control. The men all have
tanks of oil or kerosene on their backs. Wait a minute, folks,
I want to find out for sure whether it's oil or kerosene. Mumble.
Mumble. Well, folks, I'm sorry, but this gentleman doesnt
know exactly what's in the tanks. Anyway it's kerosene or oil
and there are long hoses with wide nozzles at the end. Something
like vacuumcleaners. Well, that's not quite right. Anyway
theyre lighting the nozzles now. Makes a big whoosh. Now
I'll bring the microphone closer and maybe you can catch the
noise of the flame. Hear it? That's quite a roar. I guess old
Mr Grass is cooked now.</p>

<p>"Now these boys are advancing in a straight line from the
street up over the curb, holding their fiery torches in front of
them. The devilgrass is shriveling up. Yessir, it's shriveling
right up&mdash;like a gob of tobaccojuice on a hot stove. Theyve
burned about two feet of it away already. Nothing left but
some smoking stems. Quite a lot of smoking stems&mdash;a regular
compact mass of them&mdash;but all the green stuff has been burned
right off. Yes, folks, burned clean off; I wish we had television
here so I could show you how that thick pad of stems lies there
without a bit of life left in it.</p>

<p>"Now theyre uncovering the sidewalk. I'm following right
behind with the microphone&mdash;maybe you can hear the roar of
the weedburners again. Now I'd like to have you keep in mind
the height of this grass. You never saw grass as tall as this unless
youve been in the jungle or South America or someplace where
grass grows this high. I mean high. Even here at the sidewalk<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
it's well over a man's head, seven or eight feet. And this crew is
carving right into it, cutting it like steel with an acetylenetorch.
Theyre making big holes in it. You hear that hissing? That
noise like a steamhose? Well, that's the grass shriveling. Think
of it&mdash;grass with so much sap inside it hisses. It's drying right
up in a one-two-three! Now the top part is falling down&mdash;toppling
forward&mdash;coming like a breaking wave. Oops! Hay....
It put out one of the torches by smothering it. Drowned it in
grass. Nothing serious&mdash;the boy's got it lit again. Progress is
slow here, folks&mdash;youve got to realize this stuff's about ten feet
high. Further in it's anyway sixteen feet. Fighting it's like battling
an octopus with a million arms. The stuff writhes around
and grows all the time. It's terrific. Imagine tangles of barbedwire,
hundreds and hundreds of bales or rolls or however
barbedwire comes, covering your frontyard and house&mdash;only it
isnt barbedwire at all, but green, living grass.... Just a minute,
folks, I'm having a little trouble with my microphone
cable. Nothing serious, you understand&mdash;tangled a bit in the
grass behind me. Those burnt stems. Stand by for just a
minute...."</p>

<p>"This is KPAR, The Voice of Edendale. Due to mechanical
difficulties there will be a brief musical interlude until contact
is resumed with our portable transmitter bringing you an
onthespot account of the unusual grass...."</p>

<p>"Kirk, Quork, krrmp&mdash;AR's portable transmitter. Here I am
again, folks, in the street in front of the Dinkman residence&mdash;a
little out of breath, but none the worse off, ready to resume
the blowbyblow story of the fight against the devilgrass. That
was a little trouble back there, but it's all right now. Seems the
weedburners hadnt quite finished off the grass in the parkwaystrip
between the curb and the sidewalk and after I dragged
my microphone cable across it, it sort of&mdash;well, it sort of came
to life again and tangled up the cable. It's all right now though.
Everything under control. The boys with the weedburners
have come back and are going over the parkwaystrip again, just
to make sure.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>"I want to tell you&mdash;this stuff really can grow. It's amazing,
simply amazing. Youve heard of plants growing while you look
at them; well, this grows while you don't look at it. It grows
while your back is turned. Just to give you an example: while
the boys have been busy a second time with the parkwaystrip,
the grass has come back and grown again over all they burned
up beyond the sidewalk. And now it's starting to come back
over the concrete. You can actually see it move. The creepers
run out in front and crawl ahead like thousands of little green
snakes. Imagine seeing grass traveling forward like an army of
worms. An army you can't stop. Because it's alive. Alive and
coming at you. It's alive. It's alive. It's al&mdash;"</p>

<p>"This is Station KPAR. We will resume our regular programs
immediately following the timesignal. Now we bring
you a message from the manufacturers of Chewachoc, the
Candy Laxative with the Hole...."</p>

<p>I continued thoughtfully down the street. The <i>Daily Intelligencer</i>
was spread on a newsstand, a smudgy black bannerhead
fouling its pure bosom. CITY COUNCIL MEETS TO END
GRASS MENACE.</p>

<p>I trusted so. Quickly. I was tired of Mrs Dinkman's lawn.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">13.</span> <span class="num2">"W</span>eener sahib, fate has tied us together."</p>

<p>I hoped not. I was weary of Gootes and his phony accents.</p>

<p>"On account of your female Burbank, your scientess (scientistess
is a twister. Peder Piber et a peg of piggled pebbers)
won't play ball with W R. The chief offered her a fabulous
sum&mdash;'much beer in little kegs, many dozen hardboiled eggs,
and goodies to a fabulous amount'&mdash;fabulous for W R, that is&mdash;to
act as special writer on the grass business. J S Francis, World
Renowned Chemist, exclusively in the <i>Intelligencer</i>. You
know. Suppress her unfortunate sex. ORIGINATOR OF
WILD GRASS TELLS ALL.</p>

<p>"Anyway she didnt grasp her chance. Practically told W R
to go to hell. Practically told him to go to hell," he repeated,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
evidently torn between reprehension at the sacrilege and
admiration of the daring.</p>

<p>Miss Francis plainly had what might be described as talent
that way. I debated whether to inform Gootes of my discovery
of her craziness and decided against it on the bare possibility
it would be unwise to lower the value of my connection with
the Metamorphizer's discoverer. I was soon rewarded for my
caution.</p>

<p>"O Weeneru san," continued Gootes, evidently in an oriental
vein traveling westward, "not too hard for you to be picking
up few yen. You do not hate fifty potatoes from Editor san
yesterday?"</p>

<p>"Forty," I corrected.</p>

<p>"Forty, fifty&mdash;what's the difference so long as youre healthy?"
He produced a card, showed it, tore it in half, waved his hand
and exhibited it whole and unharmed. "No kidding, chum;
the old man has the bug to make <i>you</i> a special correspondent&mdash;on
my advice yunderstand&mdash;always looking out for my pals."</p>

<p>Well, why not? The wheel of Fortune had been a long time
turning before stopping at the proper spot. I had never had any
doubt I'd someday be in a position to prove my writing ability.
Now all those who had sneered at me years before&mdash;my English
teachers and editors who had been too jealous to recognize my
existence by anything more courteous than a printed rejection&mdash;would
have to acknowledge their injustice. And in the
meantime all my accumulated experience had been added to
enhance my original talent. I'd sold everything that could be
sold doortodoor and a man acquires not only an ease with
words but a wide knowledge of human nature this way. Certainly
I was better equipped all around than many of these
highly advertised magazine or newspaper authors.</p>

<p>"Well ... I don't know if I could spare the time...."</p>

<p>"O K, bigshot. Let me know if the market goes down and
I'll come around and put up more margin."</p>

<p>"How much will Mr Le ffa&ccedil;as&eacute;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How the hell do I know? More than youre worth&mdash;more
than I'm getting, because youre a ninetyday wonder, the guy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
who put the crap on the grass and sent it nuts. Less than he'd
have given Minerva-Medusa. Come and get it straight from
the horse's mouth."</p>

<p>My only previous visits to newspaper offices had been to
place advertisements, but I was prepared to find the <i>Daily
Intelligencer</i> a veritable hive of activity. Perhaps some part of
the big building which housed the paper did hum, but not the
floor devoted to the editorial staff. That simply dozed. Gootes
led me from the elevator through an enormous room where
men and an occasional woman sat indolently before typewriters,
stared druggedly into space or flew paper airplanes out of
open windows. The only sign of animation I saw as we walked
what might well have been a quartermile was one reporter
(I judged him such by the undersized hat on the back of his
head) who enthusiastically munched a sandwich while perusing
a magazine containing photographs of women with uncovered
breasts. Even the nipples showed.</p>

<p>Beyond the cityroom was a battery of private offices. I will
certainly not conceal the existence of my extreme nervousness
as we neared the proximity of the famous editor. I hung back
from the groundglass door inscribed in shabby, peeling letters&mdash;in
distinction to its neighbors, newly and brightly painted&mdash;W.R.
Le ffa&ccedil;as&eacute;. Gootes, noting my trepidation, put on the
brogue of a burlesque Irishman.</p>

<p>"Is it afraid of Himself you are, me boy? Sure, think no more
of it. Faith, and wasnt he born Billy Casey; no better than the
rest of us for all his mother was a Clancy and related to the Finnegans?
He's written so often about coming from noble Huguenot
stock he almost believes it himself, but the Huguenots
were dirty Protestants and when his time comes W R'll send
for the priest and take the last sacraments like the true son of
the Church he is in his heart. So buck up, me boy, and come in
and view the biggest faker in journalism."</p>

<p>But Gootes' flippancy reassured me no more than did the
bare sunlit office behind the door. I had somehow, perhaps
from the movies, expected to see an editor's desk piled with
copypaper while he himself used halfadozen telephones at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
once, simultaneously making incomprehensible gestures at
countless underlings. But Mr Le ffa&ccedil;as&eacute;'s desk was nude except
for an enameled snuffbox and a signed photograph of a president
whose administration had been subjected daily to the
editor's bitterest jabs. On the walls hung framed originals of
the more famous political cartoons of the last quartercentury,
but neither telephone nor scrap of manuscript was in evidence.</p>

<p>But who could examine that office with detached scrutiny
while William Rufus Le ffa&ccedil;as&eacute; occupied it? Somnolent in a
leather armchair, he opened tiny, sunken eyes to regard us
with less than interest as we entered. Under a shiny alpaca coat
he wore an oldfashioned collarless shirt whose neckband was
fastened with a diamond stud. Neither collar nor tie competed
with the brilliance of this flashing gem resting in a shaven
stubblefold of his draped neck. His face was remarkably long,
his upperlip stretching interminably from a mouth looking to
have been freshly smeared with vaseline to a nose not unlike a
golfclub in shape. From the snuffbox on his desk, which I'd
imagined a pretty ornament or receptacle for small objects, he
scooped with a flat thumb a conical mound of graybrown dust
and this, with a sweeping upward motion, he pushed into a
gaping nostril.</p>

<p>"Chief, this is Albert Weener."</p>

<p>"How do, Mr Weener. Gootes, who the bloody hell is
Weener?"</p>

<p>"Why, Chief, he's the guy who put the stuff on the grass."</p>

<p>"Oh." He surveyed me with the attention due a worthy but
not particularly valuable specimen. "You bit the dog, ay,
Weener?"</p>

<p>Gootes burst into a high, appreciative cackle. Le ffa&ccedil;as&eacute;
turned the deathray of his left eye on him. "Youre a syncophant,
Gootes," he stated flatly, "a miserable groveling lowlivered
cringing fawning mealymouthed chickenhearted toadeating
arselicking, slobbering syncophant."</p>

<p>I couldnt see how we were ever to reach the point this way,
so I ventured, "I understand in view of the fact that I inoculated
Mrs Dinkman's lawn you want me to contribute&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>"Desires grow smaller as intelligence expands," growled
Le ffa&ccedil;as&eacute;. "I want nothing except to find a few undisturbed
moments in which to read the work of the immortal Hobbes."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," I said. "I understood you wished me to report
the progress of the wildly growing grass."</p>

<p>"Cityeditor's province," he declared uninterestedly.</p>

<p>"No such thing on the <i>Intelligencer</i>," Gootes informed me
in a loud whisper. Le ffa&ccedil;as&eacute;, who evidently heard him, glared,
reached down and retrieved the telephone from its concealment
under the desk and snarled into the mouthpiece, "I hate
to interrupt your crapgame with the trivial concerns of this
organ men called a newspaper till you got on the payroll. I'm
sending you a man who knows something about the crazy
grass. Divorce yourself from whatever pornography youre
gloating over at the moment to see if we can use him."</p>

<p>His immediate obliviousness to our presence was so insulting
that if Gootes had not made the first move to leave I should
have done so myself. I don't know what vast speculations swept
upon him as he hung up the telephone, but I thought he might
at least have had the courtesy to nod a dismissal.</p>

<p>"Youre hired, bejesus," proclaimed Gootes, and of course I
was, for there was no doubt a brilliantly successful figure like
Le ffa&ccedil;as&eacute;&mdash;whatever my opinion of his intemperate language
or failure in the niceties of deportment, he was a forceful
man&mdash;had sized me up in a flash and sensed my ability before
I'd written a single line for his paper.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">14.</span> <span class="num2">T</span>he wage offered by the <i>Daily Intelligencer</i>&mdash;even
assuming, as they undoubtedly did, that the affair
of the grass would be over shortly and my service ended&mdash;was
high enough to warrant my buying a secondhand car. A previous
unpleasantness with a financecompany made the transaction
difficult, with as little cash as I had on hand, but a
phonecall to the paper established my bonafides and I was soon
driving out Sunset Boulevard in a tomatocolored roadster,
meditating on the longdelayed upsurge of my fortunes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>The street was closed off by a road barrier quite some distance
away and tightly parked cars testified to the attraction
of the expanding grass. Scorning these idle sightseers, I pushed
and shoved my way forward to what had now become the focus
of all my interests.</p>

<p>The Dinkmans had lived in a city block, an urban entity. It
was no pretentious group of houses, nor was it a repetitive design
out of some subdividing contractor's greedy mind. Moderatesized,
mediumpriced, middleclass bungalows; these were the
homes of the Dinkmans and their neighbors; a sample from a
pattern which varied but was basically the same here and in
Oakland, Seattle and St. Louis; in Chicago, Philadelphia, Boston
and Cleveland.</p>

<p>But now I looked upon no city scene, no picture built upon
the substantial foundation of daddy at the office all day, fixing
a leaky faucet of an evening, painting the woodwork during his
summer vacation; or mom, after a pleasant afternoon with the
girls, unstintedly opening cans for supper and harassedly
watching the cleaning woman who came in once a week. An
alien presence, a rude fist through the canvas negated the convention
that this was a picture of reality. A coneshaped hill
rose to a blurred point, marking the burialplace of the Dinkman
house. It was a child's drawing of a coneshaped hill, done
in green crayon; too symmetrical, too evenly and heavily green
to be a spontaneous product of nature; man's unimaginative
hand was apparent in its composition.</p>

<p>The sides of the cone flowed past the doors and windows
of the adjacent houses, blocking them as it had previously
blocked the Dinkmans', but their inhabitants, forewarned, had
gone. More than mere desertion was implied in their going;
there was an implicit surrender, abandonment to the invader.
The base of the cone, accepting capitulation and still aggressive,
had reached to the lawns beyond, warning these householders
too to be ready for flight; over backfences to dwellings
fronting another street, and establishing itself firmly over the
concrete pavement before the Dinkmans' door.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>I would be suppressing part of the truth if I did not admit
that for the smallest moment some perverted pride made me
cherish this hill as my work, my creation. But for me it would
not have existed. I had done something notable, I had caused
a stir; it was the same kind of sensation, I imagine, which makes
criminals boast of their crimes.</p>

<p>I quickly dismissed this morbid thought, but it was succeeded
by one almost equally unhealthy, for I was ridden by a
sudden wild impulse to touch, feel, walk on, roll in the encroaching
grass. I tried to control myself, but no willing of
mine could prevent me from going up and letting the long runners
slip through my half open hands. It was like receiving
some sort of electric shock. Though the blades were soft and
tender, the stems communicated to my palms a feeling of surging
vitality, implacable life and ineluctable strength. I drew
back from the green mass as though I had been doing something
venturesome.</p>

<p>For, no matter what botanists or naturalists may tell us to the
contrary, we habitually think of plantlife as fixed and stolid,
insensate and quiescent. But this abnormal growth was no
passive lawn, no sleepy patch of vegetation. As I stood there
with fascinated attention, the thing moved and kept on moving;
not in one place, but in thousands; not in one direction,
but toward all points of the compass. It writhed and twisted in
nightmarish unease, expanding, extending, increasing; spreading,
spreading, spreading. Its movement, by human standards,
was slow, but it was so monstrous to see this great mass of verdure
move at all that it appeared to be going with express
speed, inexorably enveloping everything in its path. A crack in
the roadway disappeared under it, a shrub was swallowed up,
a patch of wall vanished.</p>

<p>The eye shifted from whole to detail and back again. The
overrun crack was duplicated by an untouched one a few
inches away&mdash;it too went; the fine tentacles on top of the mound
reached upward, shimmering like the air on a hot summer's
day, and near my feet hundreds of runners crept ever closer,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
the pale stolons shiny and brittle, supporting the ominously
bristling green leaves.</p>

<p>I hope Ive not given the impression there was no human
activity all this while, that nothing was being done to combat
the living glacier. On the contrary, there was tremendous
bustle and industry. The weedburning crew was still fighting
a rearguard action, gaining momentary successes here and
there, driving back the invading tendrils as they wriggled over
concrete sidewalk and roadway, only to be defeated as the main
mass, piling higher and ever higher, toppled forward on the
temporarily redeemed areas. For on this vastly thicker bulk the
smoky fingers of flame had no more effect than did the exertions
of the scythemen, hacking futilely away at the tough
intricacies, or the rattling reapers entangling themselves to
become like waterlogged ships.</p>

<p>But greatest hopes were now being pinned on a new weapon.
A dozen black and sootylooking tanktrucks had come up and
from them, like the arms of a squid, thick hoses lazily uncoiled.
Hundreds of gallons of dark crudeoil were being poured upon
the grass. At least ten bystanders eagerly explained to any who
would listen the purpose and value of this maneuver. Petroleum,
deadly enemy of all rooted things, would unquestionably
kill the weed. They might as well call off all the other silly
efforts, for in a day or two, as soon as the oil soaked into the
ground, the roots would die, the monster collapse and wither
away. I wanted with all my heart to believe in this hope, but
when I compared the feeble brown trickle to the vast green
body I was gravely doubtful.</p>

<p>Shaken and thoughtful, I went back to my car and drove
homeward, reflecting on the fortuitousness of human actions.
Had I not answered Miss Francis' ad someone else would have
been the agent of calamity; had Mrs Dinkman been away from
home that day another place than hers, or perhaps no place at
all, might have been engulfed.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I might still be searching for a chance
to prove my merit to the world. It seemed to me suddenly man
was but a helpless creature afterall.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">15.</span> <span class="num2">I</span>t wasnt until I was almost at my
own frontdoor I remembered the purpose of my visit, which
was not to draw philosophic conclusions, but to order my impressions
so the columns of the <i>Daily Intelligencer</i> might benefit
by the reactions of one so closely connected with the spread
of the devilgrass. I began tentatively putting sentences together
and by the time I got to my room and sat down with pencil and
paper, I was in a ferment of creative activity.</p>

<p>Now I cannot account for this, but the instant I took the
pencil in my fingers all thought of the grass left my mind. No
effort to summon back those fine rolling sentences was of the
least avail. I slapped my forehead and muttered, "Grass, grass,
Bermuda, <i>Cynodon dactylon</i>" aloud, varying it with such key
words as "Dinkman, swallowing up, green hill" and the like,
but all I could think of was buying a tire (700 x 16) for the left
rear wheel, paying my overdue rent, Gootes' infuriating buffoonery,
the possibilities for a man of my caliber in Florida or
New York, and with a couple of thousand dollars a nice mailorder
business could be established to bring in a comfortable
income....</p>

<p>I left the chair and walked up and down the cramped room
until the lodger below rapped spitefully on his ceiling. I went
to the bathroom and washed my hands. I came back and inspected
my teeth in the mirror. Then I resumed my seat and
wrote, "The Grass&mdash;" After a moment I crossed this out and
substituted, "Today, the grass&mdash;"</p>

<p>I decided the whole approach was unimaginative and unworthy
of me. I turned the paper over and began, "Like a
dragon springing&mdash;" Good, good&mdash;this was the way to start; it
would show the readers at once they were dealing with a man
of imagination. "Like a dragon springing." Springing from
what? What did dragons spring from anyway? Eggs, like
snakes? Dragons were reptiles werent they? Or werent they?
Give up the metaphor? I set my teeth with determination and
began again. "Not unlike a fierce and belligerently furious
dragon or some other ferocious, blustery and furious chimerical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
creature, a menacing and comminatory debacle is burning
fierily in the heart of our fair and increasingly populous city.
As one with an innocent yet cardinal part in the unleashing of
this dire menace, I want to describe how the exposure of this
threatening menace affected me as I looked upon its menacing
and malevolent advance today...."</p>

<p>I sat back, not dissatisfied with my beginning, and thought
about the neat little bachelor apartment I could rent on what
the <i>Intelligencer</i> was paying me. Of course in a few days this
hullabaloo would be all over&mdash;for though I had little faith in
the efficacy of the crudeoil I knew really drastic measures
would be taken soon and the whole business stopped&mdash;but even
in so short a time there could be no doubt Mr Le ffa&ccedil;as&eacute; would
realize he needed me permanently on his staff and I would be
assured of a living in my own proper sphere. Thus fired with
the thoughts of accomplishment, I returned to my task, but I
cannot say it went easily. I remembered many great writers
indulged in stimulants in the throes of composition, but I decided
such a course might blunt the keen edge of my mind and
afterall there was no better stimulant than plain oldfashioned
perseverance. I picked up the pencil again and doggedly went
on to the next sentence.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">16.</span> <span class="num2">"W</span>hat the hell's this?" demanded the
cityeditor, looking at my neatly rolled pile of manuscript.</p>

<p>I disdained to bandy words with an underling too lazy to
make an effort to get at what was probably the finest piece of
writing ever brought to him, so I unrolled my story, flattening
it out so he might read it the more easily.</p>

<p>"By the balls of Benjamin Franklin and the little white
fringe on Horace Greeley's chin, this goddamned thing's been
wrote by hand! Arent there any typewriters anymore? Did
Mister Remington commit suicide unbeknownst to me?"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," I said stiffly. "I didnt think youd have any difficulty
in reading my handwriting." And in fact the whole business
was absurd, for if there's anything I pride myself on it's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
the gracefulness and legibility of my penmanship. Typewriters
might well be mandatory for the ephemeral news item, but I
had been hired as a special correspondent and someday my
manuscript would be a valuable property.</p>

<p>The cityeditor eyed me in a most disagreeable fashion. "I'm
an educated man," he stated. "Groton, Harvard and the WPA.
No doubt with time and care I could decipher this bid for next
year's Pulitzer prize. But I must consider the more handicapped
members of the staff: compositors, layoutmen and
proofreaders; without my advantages and broadmindedness
they might be so startled by this innovation as to have their
usefulness permanently crippled. No; I'm afraid, Mr Weener,
I must ask you to put this in more orthodox form and type it
up."</p>

<p>Just another example of pettish bureaucracy, the officiousness
of the jack-in-office. Except for the nuisance, it didnt
particularly matter. When Mr Le ffa&ccedil;as&eacute; read my contribution
I knew there would be no concern in future whether it was
handwritten, typewritten, or engraved in Babylonic cuneiform
on a freshly baked brick.</p>

<p>Nevertheless I went over to one of the unoccupied desks and
began to copy what I had written on the machine. I must say I
was favorably impressed by the appearance of my words in this
form, for they somehow looked more important and enduring.
While still engaged in this task I was slapped so heartily on
the back I was knocked forward against the typewriter and
Gootes perched himself on a corner of the desk.</p>

<p>"Working the jolly old mill, what? I say, the old bugger
wants to know where your stuff is. Fact of the matter, he wants
to know with quite a bit of deuced bad language. Not a softspoken
chap, you know, W R."</p>

<p>"I'll be through in a minute or two."</p>

<p>He gathered his pipe apparently out of my left ear and his
tobacco pouch from the air and very rudely, without asking
my permission, picked up the top sheet and started to read it.
A thick eyebrow shot up immediately and he allowed his pipe
to hang slackly from his mouth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>"Purple," he exclaimed, "magenta, violet, lavender, mauve.
Schmaltz, real copperriveted, brassbound, steeljacketed, castiron
schmaltz. I havent seen such a genuine sample since my
kid sister wrote up Jack the Ripper back in 1889."</p>

<p>The manifest discrepancy in these remarks so confused me
my fingers stumbled over the typewriter keys. Evidently he
intended some kind of humor or sarcasm, but I could make
nothing of it. How could his younger sister...?</p>

<p>"Bertie boy," he said, after I had struggled to get another
paragraph down, "it breaks my heart to see you toil so. Let's
take in as much as youve done to the chief and either he'll be
so impressed he'll put a stenographer to transcribing the rest
or else&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Or else?" I prompted.</p>

<p>"Or else he won't. Come on."</p>

<p>Mr Le ffa&ccedil;as&eacute; had apparently not stirred since last we were
in his office. He opened his eyes, thumbed a pinch of snuff and
asked Gootes, "Where the bloody hell is that stuff on the
grass?"</p>

<p>"Here it is, Chief. No date, no who what when and where,
but very litry. Very, very litry."</p>

<p>The editor picked up my copy and I could not help but
watch him anxiously for some sign of his reaction. It came
forth promptly and explosively.</p>

<p>"What the ingenious and delightfully painful hell is this,
Gootes?"</p>

<p>"'As Reported by Our Special Writer, Albert Weener, The
Man Who Inoculated the Loony Grass.'"</p>

<p>"Gootes, you are the endproduct of a long line of incestuous
idiots, the winner of the boobyprize in any intelligencetest,
but you have outdone yourself in bringing me this verminous
and maggoty ordure," said Le ffa&ccedil;as&eacute;, throwing my efforts to
the floor and kicking at them. The outrage made me boil and
if he had not been an older man I might have done him an injury.
"As for you, Weener, I doubt if you will ever be elevated
to the ranks of idiocy. Get the sanguinary hell out of here and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
do humanity the favor to step in front of the first tentontruck
driving by."</p>

<p>"One minute, Chief," urged Gootes. "Don't be hasty. Seen
the latest on the grass? Well, the mayor's asked the governor
to call out the National Guard; the <i>Times</i>'ll have an interview
with Einstein tomorrow and the <i>Examiner</i>'s going to run a
symposium of what Herbert Hoover, Bernard Shaw and General
MacArthur think of the situation. Don't suppose perhaps
we could afford to ghost Bertie here?"</p>

<p>Was I never to escape from the malice inspired by the envy
my literary talent aroused? I had certainly expected that a
man of the famous editor's reputation would be above such
pettiness. I was too dismayed and downcast by the meanness
of human nature to speak.</p>

<p>Le ffa&ccedil;as&eacute; snuffed again and looked malevolently at the wall.
A framed caricature of himself returned the stare. "Very well,"
he grudgingly conceded at length, "youre on the grass anyway,
so you might as well take this on too. Leave you only twentytwo
hours a day to sleep in. You, Weener, are still on the payroll&mdash;at
half the agreedupon figure."</p>

<p>I opened my mouth to protest, but he turned on me with a
snarl; baring yellow and twisted teeth, unpleasant to see.
"Weener, you look like a criminal type to me; Lombroso
couldve used you for a model to advantage. Have you a policerecord
or have you so far evaded the law? Let me tell you, the
<i>Intelligencer</i> is the evildoers' nemesis. Is your conscience clear,
your past unsullied as a virgin's bed, your every deed open to
search? Do you know what a penitentiary's like? Did you ever
hear the clang of a celldoor as the turnkey slammed it behind
him and left you to think and stew and weep in a silence accented
and made more wretched by a yellow electricbulb and
the stink of corrosivesublimate? Back to the cityroom, you
dabbling booby, you precious simpleton, addlepated dunce,
and be thankful my boundless generosity permits you to draw
a weekly paycheck at all and doesnt condemn you to labor
forever unrewarded in the subterranean vaults where the old
files are kept."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>First Miss Francis and now Le ffa&ccedil;as&eacute;. Were all these great
intelligences touched? Was the world piloted by unbalanced
minds? It seemed incredible, impossible it should be so, but
two such similar experiences in so short a time apparently
supported this gloomy view. Horrible, I thought as I preceded
Gootes out of the maniac's office, unbelievably horrible.</p>

<p>"Son," advised Gootes, "never argue with the chief. He has
the makings of a firstclass apoplexy&mdash;I hope. You just keep
squawking to the bookkeeping department and youll get further
than coming up against the Old Man. Now let's go out
and look at nature in the raw."</p>

<p>"But my copy," I protested.</p>

<p>"Oh, that," he said airily, "I'll run that off when we come
back. Deadlines mean nothing to Jacson Gootes, the compositors'
companion, the proofreaders' pardner, the layoutman's
love. Come, Se&ntilde;or Veener, we take look at el grasso grosso by
the moonlight."</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">17.</span> <span class="num2">H</span>owever, it was not moonlight illuminating
the weird tumulus, but the glare of a battery of
searchlights, suggesting, as Gootes irreverently remarked, the
opening of a new supermarket. During my absence the National
Guard had arrived and focused the great incandescent
beams on the mound which now covered five houses and whose
threat had driven the inhabitants from as many more. The
powdery blue lights gave the grass an uncanny yellowish look,
as though it had been stricken by a disease.</p>

<p>The rays, directed low, were constantly being interrupted
by the bodies of the militiamen hurrying back and forth to
accomplish some definite task. "What goes on?" inquired
Gootes.</p>

<p>The officer addressed had two gleaming silver bars on his
shoulder. He seemed very young and nervous. "Sorry&mdash;no one
allowed this far without special authorization."</p>

<p>"Working press." Gootes produced a reporter's badge from
the captain's bars.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh. Excuse me. Say, that was a sharp little stunt, Mr&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Name of Jacson Gootes. <i>Intelligencer</i>."</p>

<p>"Captain Eltwiss. How did you learn stuff like that?"</p>

<p>I looked at him, for the name was somehow vaguely familiar.
But to the best of my knowledge I had never seen that smooth,
boyish face before.</p>

<p>"Talent. Natural talent. What did you say all the shootin
was about?"</p>

<p>"Getting ready to tunnel under," answered the officer affably.
"Blow the thing skyhigh from the middle and get rid of
it right now. Not going to let any grass grow under our feet."</p>

<p>"But I read an article saying neither dynamite, TNT nor
nitroglycerin would be effective against the grass; might even
do more harm than good."</p>

<p>"Writers." Captain Eltwiss dismissed literature without
even resorting to an exclamationpoint. "Writers." To underline
his confidence the boneshaking chatter of pneumatic
chisels began a syncopated rattle. Military directness would
accomplish in one swift, decisive stroke at the heart of things
what civilian fumbling around the edges had failed to do.</p>

<p>I looked with almost sentimental regret at the great conical
heap. I had brought it into being; in a few hours it would be
gone and whatever fame its brief existence had given me would
be gone with it.</p>

<p>With swift method the guardsmen started burrowing. In
ordered relays, fresh workers replaced tired, and the pile of
excavated dirt grew. Since their activity, except for its urgency
and the strangeness of the situation, didnt differ from labors
observable any time a street was repaired or a foundation laid,
I saw no point in watching, hour after hour. I thought Gootes'
persistence less a devotion to duty than the idle curiosity which
makes grown men gape at a steamshovel.</p>

<p>My hints being lost on him, I ascertained the hour they expected
to be finished and went home. Excitement or no excitement,
I saw no reason to abandon all routine. My forethought
was proven when I returned refreshed in midmorning as the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
last shovelfuls of dirt came from the tunnel and the explosive
charges were hurried to their place.</p>

<p>There was reason for haste. While the tunneling had been
going on, all the grassfighting activity had ceased, for the
militia had ordered weedburners, reapers, bulldozers and the
rest off the scene. The weed, unhampered for the first time
since Mrs Dinkman attacked it with her lawnmower, responded
by growing and growing until more and more guardsmen
had to be detached to the duty of keeping it back from
the excavation&mdash;by the very means they had scorned so recently.
Even their most frantic efforts could not prevent the grass from
sending its most advanced tendrils down into the gaping hole
where the wires were being laid to detonate the charge.</p>

<p>There was so much dashing to and fro, so many orders relayed,
so many dispatches delivered that I thought I might
have been witnessing an outofdate Civilwar play instead of a
peacetime action of the California National Guard. Captain
Eltwiss&mdash;I kept wondering where I'd heard the name&mdash;was
constantly being interrupted in what was apparently a very
friendly conversation with Gootes by the arrival of officiallooking
envelopes which he immediately stuffed into his
pocket with every indication of vexation. "Silly old fools," he
muttered, each time the incident happened.</p>

<p>Quick inspections made, plans checked, an order was rasped
to clear the vicinity. Gootes' agonized protest that he had to
report the occasion for the <i>Intelligencer</i>'s readers was ignored.
"Can't start making exceptions," explained Captain Eltwiss.
Everyone&mdash;workingpress, militia, sightseers and all, had to
move back a couple of blocks where intervening trees and
houses cut us off from any view of the green hill.</p>

<p>"This is terrible," exclaimed Gootes frantically. "Tragic.
Howll I live it down? Howm I going to face W R? Godlike
wrath. 'What poolhall were you dozing in, Gootes? Asleep on
your bloody feet, ay, somnambulistic offspring of a threetoed
sloth?' Wait all night for a story and then not get it, like the
star legman on the Jackson Junior Highschool <i>Jive-Jitterbug</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
I'll never be able to hold my head up again. Say something,
say something, Weener&mdash;Ive <i>got</i> to get this."</p>

<p>"We'll be able to hear the explosion from here," I remarked
to console him, for his distress was genuine.</p>

<p>"Oh," he groaned. "Hear the explosion. Albert, Albert ...
you have a fertile mind. Why didnt I hide myself before they
told us to clear out? Why didnt I get W R to hire a plane? Why
didnt I foresee this and do any of a hundred things? A microphone
and automatic moviecamera ... Goony Gootes, they
called him, the man who missed all bets.... A captive balloon,
now.... Hay! What about a roof?"</p>

<p>"Trees," I objected, with a mental picture of him bursting
into the nearest house and demanding entrance to the roof.</p>

<p>"Bushwa. Zair's no tree in z' way of z' old box over zair&mdash;allons!"</p>

<p>It wasnt till he had urged me inside and up a flight of stairs
that I realized the "box" was Miss Francis' apartmenthouse.
It had been a logical choice, since its height and ugliness distinguished
it even from its unhandsome neighbors. Less than
a week had gone by since I had come here for the first time.
As I followed Gootes' grasshopper leaps upward at a more
dignified pace, I reflected how strangely my circumstances had
changed.</p>

<p>The shoddily carpeted halls were musty and still as we
climbed, except for the unheeded squeaking of a radio someone
had forgotten to turn off. You could always tell when a
radio was being listened to, for when disregarded it sulkily
gave off painfully listless noises in frustration and loneliness.</p>

<p>I wasnt at all surprised to find Miss Francis among the spectators
crowded on the roof in evidence of having no more important
occupation. "I somehow expected you. Have you any
new tricks?" she asked Gootes coaxingly.</p>

<p>"Ecod, your worship, wot time ave I for legerdemain? Wif
your elp, now, I'd be a fine gentleman-journalist, stead of a
noverworked ack."</p>

<p>"Ha," she said genially, busy with the toothpick, "youll<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
find enough respectable laboratory mechanics eager to cooperate.
How long will it be before they shoot, do you know?"</p>

<p>Gootes shook his head and I strained my eyes toward the
grass. Symmetrical and shimmeringly green, removed as it now
was from all connotations of danger by distance and the promise
of immediate destruction, it showed serenely beautiful and
unaffected by the machinations of its attackers. I could almost
have wept as I traced its sloping sides upward to the rounded
peak on top. Reversing all previous impressions, it now appeared
to be the natural inhabitant and all the houses, roadways,
pavements, fences, automobiles, lightpoles and the rest
of the evidences of civilization the intruders.</p>

<p>But even as I looked at it so eagerly it moved and wavered
and I heard the muffled boom of explosion. The roof trembled
and windows rattled with diminishing echoes. The noise was
neither a great nor terrifying one and I distinctly remember
thinking it quite inadequate to the occasion.</p>

<p>I believe all of us there, when we heard the report, expected
to see a vast hole where the grass had been. I'm sure I did. When
it was clear this hadnt happened, I continued to stare hard,
thinking, since my highschool physics was so hazy, I had somehow
reversed the relative speed of sight and sound and we had
heard the noise before seeing the destruction.</p>

<p>But the green bulk was still there.</p>

<p>Oh, not unchanged, by any means. The smooth, picturebook
slope had become jagged and bruised while the regular, evenlyrounded
apex had turned into a sort of phrygian cap with its
pinnacle woundedly askew. The outlines which had been
sharp were now blurred, its evenness had become scraggly.
The placid surface was vexed; the attempt on its being had
hurt. But not mortally, for even with outline altered, it remained;
defiant, certain, inexorable.</p>

<p>The air was filled with small green particles whirling and
floating downward. Feathery, yet clumsy, they refused to obey
gravity and seek the earth urgently, but instead shifted and
changed direction, coyly spiraling upward and sideways before
yielding to the inevitable attraction.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>"At least there's less of it," observed Gootes. "This much
anyway," he added, holding a broken stolon in his fingers.</p>

<p>"<i>Cynodon dactylon</i>," said Miss Francis, "like most of the
family Gramineae, is propagated not only by seed, but by cuttings
as well. That is to say, any part of the plant (except the
leaves or flowers) separated from the parent whole, upon receiving
water and nourishment will root itself and become a
new parent or entity. The dispersion of the mass, far from
making the whole less, as our literary friend so ingenuously
assumes, increases it to what mathematicians call the <i>n</i>th power
because each particle, finding a new restingplace unhampered
by the competition for food it encountered when integrated
with the parent mass, now becomes capable of spreading infinitely
itself unless checked by factors which deprive it of
sustenance. These facts have been repeated a hundred times
in letters, telegrams and newspaper articles since the project
of attempting to blow up the inoculated batch was known. In
spite of warnings the authorities chose to go ahead. No, make
no mistake, this fiasco has not set <i>Cynodon dactylon</i> back a
millimeter; rather it has advanced it tremendously."</p>

<p>There was silence while we absorbed this unpleasant bit of
information. Gootes was the first to regain his usual cockiness
and he asked, "You say fiasco, professor. O K&mdash;can you tell us
just why it was a fiasco? I know they stuck enough soup under
it to blow the whole works and when it went off it gave out
with a good bang."</p>

<p>"Certainly. <i>Cynodon dactylon</i> spreads in what may be called
jumps. That is, the stems are short and jointed. Those aboveground,
the true stems, are called stolons, and those below,
from which the roots spread, are rhizomes. Conceive if you will
twoinch lengths of stiff wire&mdash;and this plant is vulgarly called
wiregrass in some regions just as it is called devilgrass here&mdash;bent
on either end at rightangles. Now take these bits and
weave them horizontally into a thick mass. Then add, vertically,
more of the wires, breaking the pattern occasionally and
putting in more in odd places, just to be sure there are no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
logical fracturepoints. Cover this involved web&mdash;not forgetting
it has three dimensions despite my instructions treating
it as a plane&mdash;with earth, eight, ten, or twelve inches deep.
Then try to blow it up with dynamite or trinitrotoluene and
see if you havent&mdash;in a much lesser degree&mdash;duplicated and
accounted for the situation in hand."</p>

<p>Everything now seemed unusually and, perhaps because of
the contrast, unreasonably quiet. Downstairs the radio, which
had been monotonously soothing a presumptive audience of
unsatisfied housewives with languid ballads, raised its pitch
several tones as though for the first time it had become interested
in what it purveyed.</p>

<p>"... Yes, unseen friends, God is preparing His vengeance
for wickedness and sin, even as you are listening. You have
been warned many times of the wrath to come, but I say to
you, the wrath is at hand. Even now God is giving you a sign
of His displeasure; a cloud no bigger than a man's hand. But,
O my unseen friends, that cloud has within it all the storms,
cyclones, typhoons, hurricanes and tornadoes necessary to destroy
you and yours. Unless you repent of your pride and sloth,
Judgment will surely come upon you. The Lord has taken a
simple and despis&egrave;d weed and caused it to multiply in defiance
of all your puny powers and efforts. O my friends, do not fight
this grass, but cherish it; do not allow it to be cut down for
it is full of significance for you. Call off all your minions
and repent, lest if the holy messenger be injured a more terrible
one is sent. But now, my friends, I see my time is up;
please send your contributions so urgently needed to carry on
the Divine Work to Brother Paul care of the station to which
you are listening."</p>

<p>"That's one way of looking at it," said Gootes. "Adios
amigos."</p>

<p>He went down the stairs at an even more breakneck pace
than he had come up. Almost in front of the apartmenthouse
door we nearly collided with two officers in angry dispute.</p>

<p>"You mean to tell me, Captain, that not one of the urgent
orders to suspend operations came through to you?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>"Colonel, I havent seen a thing against the project except
some fool articles in a newspaper."</p>

<p>Suddenly I remembered where I'd seen the name Eltwiss. It
was on the financial page, not far away from the elusive quotation
on Consolidated Pemmican and Allied Concentrates
for which I'd been idly searching. "Eltwiss Explosives Cut
Melon." Funny how things come back to you as soon as you
put them out of your mind.</p>

<p>Miss Francis, who had followed us down was busy collecting
some of the stolons which were still floating lazily downward.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">18.</span> <span class="num2">A</span>n illiterate patchwork of lifeless
and uninteresting scribbling appeared under my byline day
after day in the <i>Intelligencer</i>. Not a word, not a thought of my
own was left. I was not restrained from protest by the absurd
threats of Le ffa&ccedil;as&eacute;, but prudence dictated not throwing away
dirty water before I got clean, and the money from the paper,
while negligible of course, yet provided my most pressing
needs.</p>

<p>As I was being paid for my name while my talents went to
waste, I was free to go anywhere I pleased, but I had little
desire to leave the vicinity of the grass. It exerted upon me,
more understandably, the same fascination as on the merely
curious.</p>

<p>But I was not permitted unmolested access to the phenomenon
with which I was so closely concerned. An officious young
guardsman warned me away brusquely and I was not allowed
to come near until I swallowed my pride and claimed connection
with the <i>Intelligencer</i>. Even then it was necessary for
me to explain myself to several nervous soldiers on pain of
being ordered from the spot.</p>

<p>I was struck as I had not been before by the dynamic quality
of the grass; never the same for successive instants. Constant
movement and struggle as the expanding parts fought for
room among themselves, pushing upward and outward,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
seemed to indicate perceptible sentience permeating the whole
body. Preparing, brooding, it was disturbed, searching, alert.</p>

<p>Its external aspect reflected the change. The proportions of
height to breadth had altered since the explosion. The peak
had disappeared, flattening out into an irregular plateau. Its
progress across the ground, however, had been vastly accelerated;
it had crossed the streets on all sides of the block and
was spreading with great rapidity over the whole district. For
the moment no new effort was apparently being made to halt
its progress, the activities of the militia being confined to
patrolling the area and shooing decent citizens away. I wondered
if a new strategy contemplated allowing the thing to
exhaust itself. Since it looked more vigorous with each passing
hour, I saw myself on the payroll of the <i>Intelligencer</i> for a
long time to come.</p>

<p>Captain Eltwiss walked by and I asked him if this were so.
"Don't worry," he reassured me. "We're hep now, with the
actual, unbeatable mccoy. Park the body and watch what
happens to old Mr Grass."</p>

<p>I had every intention of staying and I thought it advisable
to remain close to the captain in order, if his boast were wellfounded,
to be in on the kill. He was in excellent spirits and
although I did not think it tactful to refer to it, it was evident
his little difference with the colonel about the unreceived
orders had not affected him. We chatted amiably. I mentioned
what Miss Francis had said about the weed springing up in
new places from each of the shreds dispersed by the explosion,
but he merely shrugged and laughed.</p>

<p>"I know these longbearded scientific nuts. They can find
calamity around the corner quicker than a drunk can find a
bar."</p>

<p>"The discoverer of the Metamorphizer is a woman, so her
long beard is doubtful," I told him, just a little irritated by
his cocksureness.</p>

<p>He laughed with as much ease at himself as at anything else.
"A woman scientist, ay? Funny things womenll do when they
can't get a man. But longbearded or flatchested it's all the same.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
Gruesome, that's what they are, gruesome. Forget it. After we
get this cleaned up we'll take care of any others that start,
but personally I don't think therell be any. Sounds like a lot
of theory to me."</p>

<p>I looked contemptuously at him, for he had that unimaginative
approach which disdains Science and so holds Civilization
back on its upward path. If the world's future rested with
people like this, I thought, we should never have had dynamite
or germtheories or airplanes capable of destroying whole
cities at a blow.</p>

<p>But Captain Eltwiss was a servant to the Science he looked
down on. The answer he had bragged about now appeared and
it was a scientific contribution if ever there was one. A division
of tanks, twenty or thirty of them with what appeared to be
sledrunners invertedly attached to their fronts, rolled into
sight. "Wirecutters," he explained with pride. "Same equipment
used for barbedwire on the Normandy beachhead. Go
through anything like cheese."</p>

<p>The tanks drew up in a semicircle and the drivers came out
of their vehicles for lastminute preparations. A final check
was made of gas, oil, and the positions of the wirecutters. Maps,
showing the location of each house now covered by the grass,
were studied and compasspoints checked against them. I admired
the thoroughness and efficiency of the arrangements. So
did the captain.</p>

<p>"The idea is simple. These tanks are shocktroops. Theyll
cut their way into the middle of the stuff. This will give us
entranceways and a central operating point, besides hitting the
grass where its strength is greatest. From there&mdash;" he paused
impressively&mdash;"from there we'll throw everything in the book
at it and a few that arent. All the stuff they used before we came.
Only we'll use it efficiently. And everything else. Even hush-hush
stuff. Just got the release from Washington. The minute
one of these stems shows we'll stamp it out. We'll fight it and
fight it until we beat it and we won't leave a bit of it, no, sir,
not one bit of it, alive."</p>

<p>He looked at me triumphantly. Behind his triumph was a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
hint of the vast resources and the slowmoving but unassailable
force his uniform represented. It sounded as though he had
been correct in his boast and something drastic indeed would
"happen to Mr. Grass."</p>

<p>The tanks were ready to go at last and the drivers climbed
back into them and disappeared, leaving the steel monsters
looking as though theyd swallowed the men. Like bubbles
of air in a narrow glass tube they began to jerk backward and
forward, until at some signal&mdash;I presume given by radio&mdash;they
jumped ahead, their exhausts bellowing defiance of the grass
mauled and torn by their treads.</p>

<p>They went onward with careless scorn, leaving behind a
bruised and trampled pathway. The captain followed in the
track and I after him, though I must admit it was not without
some trepidation I put my feet upon the battered and now
lifeless mass packed into a hard roadbed, for I recalled clearly
how the grass had wrenched the ladder from the firemen and
how it had impishly attacked the broadcaster's equipment.</p>

<p>The tanks moved ahead steadily until the slope of the
mound began to rise sharply and the runners of grass, instead
of flattening obediently behind, curled and twisted grotesquely
as the tracks passed over them, lightly slapping at the impervious
steel sides. Small bunches, mutilated and crushed, sprang
back into erectness, larger ones flopped limply as their props
were pushed aside.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, the tank we were trailing disappeared.
There was no warning; one second it was pursuing its way, an
implacable executioner, the next it had plunged into the weed
and was lost to sight. The ends of the grass came together
spitefully behind it, weaving themselves together, knitting,
as we watched, an opaque blanket. It closed over and around
so that the smooth track ended abruptly, bitten by a wiry
green portcullis.</p>

<p>I was dismayed, but the captain seemed happy. "Now we're
getting somewhere," he exclaimed. "The little devils are eating
right into the heart of the old sonofabitch."</p>

<p>We stood there gaping stupidly after our lost champion, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
the grass mound was enigmatic and offered us no information
as to its progress. A survey of the other tracks showed their
tanks, too, had burrowed into the heart of the weed like so
many hounds after a rabbit.</p>

<p>"Well," said the captain, who by now had apparently accepted
me as his confidant, "let's go and see what's coming in
over the radio."</p>

<p>I was glad to be reminded the tanks werent lost, even temporarily,
and that we would soon learn of their advance. Field
headquarters had been set up in a house about two blocks away
and there, after exchanging salutes, passwords, and assorted
badinage, the captain led. The men in contact with the tanks,
shoulders hunched, fingers rapid with pad and pencil, were sitting
in a row by a wall on which had been tacked a large and
detailed map of the district.</p>

<p>In addition to their earphones, a loudspeaker had also been
thoughtfully set up, apparently to take care of any such curious
visitors as ourselves. The disadvantage, soon manifest, was that
no plan had been devised to unscramble the reports from the
various tanks. As a consequence, whenever two or three came
in together, the reports overlapped, resulting in a jumble of
unintelligible sounds from the loudspeaker.</p>

<p>"Brf brf brm," it was saying as we entered the room. "Rrr
rrr about three hundred meters khorof khorof khorof north by
northeast. Can you hear me, FHQ? Come in, FHQ."</p>

<p>There was a further muddle of words, then, "I think my
motor's going to conk out. Shall I backtrack, FHQ? Come in,
FHQ."</p>

<p>"Rugged place to stall," commented captain Eltwiss sympathetically,
"but we can pull him out in halfashake soons we
get things under control."</p>

<p>The loudspeaker, after a great deal of gibberish, condescended
to clarity again. "... about five hundred meters.
Supposed to join SMT5 at this point. Can't raise him by radio.
What do you have on SMT5, FHQ? Come in, FHQ."</p>

<p>I was still speculating as to what had happened to SMT5
when the loudspeaker once more became intelligible. "... and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
the going's getting tougher all the time. I don't believe these
goddamned wirecutters are worth a pissinasnowhole. Just
fouled up, that's what they are, just fouled up. Got further if
theyd been left off."</p>

<p>His grumbling was blotted out. For a moment there was
complete babel, then "... if I can guess, it's somehow got
in the motor and shorted the ignition. Ive got to take a chance
and get out to look at it. This is SMT3 reporting to FHQ. Now
leaving the transmitter."</p>

<p>"... stalled so I turned on my lights. Can you hear me,
FHQ? Come in FHQ, O K, O K, don't get sore. So I turned
on my lights. I'm not going to do a Bob Trout, but I want to
tell you it's pretty creepy. I guess this stuff looks pretty and
green enough on top, especially in daylight, but from where
I am now it's like an illustration out of Grimm's <i>Fairy Tales</i>&mdash;something
about the place where the wicked ogre lived. Not a
bit of green. Not a bit of light except from my own which penetrate
about two feet ahead and stop. Dead. Yellow and reddishbrown
stems. Thick. Interlaced. How the hell I ever got this
far I'd like to know. But not as much as how I'm going to
get out.</p>

<p>"I'm sticking my head out of the turret now. As far as these
stemsll let me. Which isnt far. Theyre a solid mass on top of
the machine. And beside it. I'm going to take a few tools and
make for the engine. Only thing to do. Can't sit here and describe
grassroots to you dogrobbers all day long. See if I can't
get her running and back out. Then I resign from the state of
California. Right then. This is SMT7 leaving the transmitter
for essential repairs and signing off."</p>

<p>For hours the reports kept coming in, all in identically the
same vein: rapid progress followed by a slowdown, then either
engine trouble or a failure to keep rendezvous by another tank,
all messages concluding alike: "Now leaving transmitter." It
was no use for field headquarters frantically to order them to
stay in their tanks no matter what happened. They were young,
ablebodied, impatient men and when something went wrong
they crawled out to fight their way through a few feet of grass<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
to fix it. Afterall they were in the heart of a great city. Their
machines had burrowed straightforwardly into the grass and
no threats of courtmartial could make them sit and look silly
till help arrived and they were tamely rescued. So one by one
they wormed their way out to fix the ignition, adjust the carburetor,
or hack free the cogs which moved the tracks. And
one by one their radios became silent and were not heard again.</p>

<p>The captain went from cockiness to doubt, from doubt to
anxiety, and then to anguished fury. He had been so completely
confident of the maneuver's outcome that its failure
drove him, not to despair, but to anger. He knew most of the
tankdrivers personally and the picture of these friends trapped
in their tiny, evernarrowing pockets of green sent him into a
frenzy. "SMT1&mdash;that's Lew Brown. Don't get out, Lew&mdash;stay
where you are, you jackass. Stay where you are, Lew," he bellowed
into the unresponsive loudspeaker.</p>

<p>"Jake White. Jake White's in four. Said I'd buy him a drink
afterwards. Joke. He's a cocacola boy. Why can't you stay inside,
Jake? Why can't you stay put?"</p>

<p>Unable to bear it longer, he rushed from field headquarters
shouting, "Let's get'm out, boys, let's get'm out," and would
personally have led a volunteer party charging on foot into the
grass if he had not been forcibly restrained and sympathetically
led away, sobbing hysterically, toward hospitalization and
calming treatment.</p>

<p>The captain's impulse, though impractical, was shared by
all his comrades. For the moment the destruction of the grass
became secondary to the rescue of the trapped tankmen. If
field headquarters had bustled before, it now turned into a
veritable beehive, with officers shouting, exhorting, complaining,
and men running backwards and forwards as though there
were no specific for the situation except unlimited quantities
of their own sweat.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">19.</span> <span class="num2">I</span>t would be futile to relate, even if
I could recall them, all the various methods and devices which
were suggested and rejected or tried and proved failures in the
attempt to rescue the tankdrivers. Press and radio followed
every daring essay and carefully planned endeavor until the
last vicarious quiver had been wrung from a fascinated public.
For twentyfour hours there was no room on the front pages
of the newspapers for anything but the latest on the "prisoners
of the grass," as they were at first called. Later, when hope for
their rescue had diminished and they were forced from the
limelight to make way for later developments, they were
known simply as "heroes in the fight against the weird enemy."</p>

<p>For the grass had not paused chivalrously during the
interval. On the contrary, it seemed to take renewed vigor from
the victims it had entombed. House after house, block after
block were engulfed. The names of those forced from their
homes were no longer treated individually and written up as
separate stories, but listed in alphabetical order, like battle
casualties. Miss Francis, frantically trying to get all her specimens
and equipment moved from her kitchen in time, had
been ousted from the peeling stucco and joined those who were
finding shelter (with some difficulty) in other parts of the city.</p>

<p>The southernmost runners crept down toward Hollywood
Boulevard where every effort was being marshaled to combat
them, and the northernmost wandered around and seemingly
lost themselves in the desert of sagebrush and greasewood
about Hollywood Bowl. Traffic through Cahuenga Pass, the
great artery between Los Angeles and its tributary valley, was
threatened with disruption.</p>

<p>But while the parent body was spreading out, its offspring,
as Miss Francis foresaw, had come into existence. Dozens of
nuclei were reported, some close at hand, others far away as the
Sunset Strip and Hollywoodland. These smaller bodies were
vigorously attacked as soon as discovered but of course they
had in every case made progress too great to be countered, for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
they were at first naturally indistinguishable from ordinary
devilgrass and by the time their true character was determined
so rapid was their growth they were already beyond all possibility
of control.</p>

<p>The grass was now everyone's primary thought, replacing
the moon (among lovers), the incometax (among individuals
of importance), the weather (among strangers), and illness
(among ladies no longer interested in the moon), as topics of
conversation. Old friends meeting casually after many years'
lapse greeted each other with "What's the latest on the grass?"
Radiocomedians fired gagmen with weeks of service behind
them for failure to provide botanical quips, or, conversely,
hired raw writers who had inhabited the fringes of Hollywood
since Mack Sennett days on the strength of a single agrostological
illusion. Newspapers ran long articles on <i>Cynodon
dactylon</i> and the editors of their garden sections were roused
from the somnolence into which they had sunk upon receiving
their appointment and shoved into doubleleaded boldfaced
position.</p>

<p>Textbooks on botany began outselling popular novels and
a mere work of fiction having the accidental title <i>Greener
Than You Think</i> was catapulted onto the bestseller list before
anyone realized it wasnt an academic discussion of the family
Gramineae. Contributors to scientifiction magazines burst
bloodvessels happily turning out ten thousand words a day describing
their heroes' adventures amid the red grass of Mars
or the blue grass of Venus after they had singlehanded&mdash;with
the help of a deathray and the heroine's pure love&mdash;conquered
the green grass of Tellus.</p>

<p>Professors, shy and otherwise, were lured from their classrooms
to lecture before ladies' clubs hitherto sacred to the
accents of transoceanic celebrities and Eleanor Roosevelt.
There they competed on alternate forums with literate gardeners
and stuttering horticultural amateurs. Stolon, rhizome
and culm became words replacing crankshaft and piston in the
popular vocabulary; the puerile reports Gootes fabricated
under my name as the man responsible for the phenomenon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
were syndicated in newspapers from coast to coast, and a query
as to rates was received from the <i>Daily Mail</i>.</p>

<p>Brother Paul's exhortations on the radio increased in both
length and intensity as the grass spread. Pastors of other
churches and conductors of similar programs denounced him
as misled; realestate operators, fearful of all this talk about the
grass bringing doom and so depreciating the value of their
properties, complained to the Federal Communications Commission;
Sundayschools voted him the Man of the Year and
hundreds of motherly ladies stored the studio with cakes
baked by their own hands. Brother Paul's answer to indorser
and detractor alike was to buy up more radiotime.</p>

<p>No one doubted the government would at length awaken
from its apathy and counter the menace swiftly and efficiently,
as always before in crises when the country was threatened.
The nation with the highest rate of production per manhour,
the greatest efficiency per machine, the greatest wealth per
capita, and the greatest vision per mindseye was not going to
be defeated by a mere weed, however overgrown. While waiting
the inevitable action and equally inevitable solution the
public had all the excitement of war without suffering the accompanying
privations and bereavements. The grass was a
nuisance, but a nuisance with titillating compensations; most
people felt like children whose schoolhouse had burned down;
they were sorry, they knew there'd be a new one, they were
quite ready to help build it&mdash;but in the meantime it was fun.</p>

<p>The <i>Daily Intelligencer</i> was gorged with letters from its
readers on the subject of the grass. Many of them wanted to
know what a newspaper of its standing meant by devoting so
much space to an ephemeral happening, while many more
asked indignantly why more space wasnt given to something
affecting their very lives and fortunes. Communist partymembers,
using improbable pennames, asked passionately if this
was not a direct result of the country's failure to come to a
thorough understanding with the Soviet Union? Terrified
propertyholders irately demanded that something, SOMETHING<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
be done before realestate became as valueless in
Southern California as it already was in Red Russia.</p>

<p>Technocrats demanded the government be immediately
turned over to a committee of engineers and competent
agronomists who would deal with the situation as it deserved
after harnessing the wasted energy of the populace. Nationalists
hinted darkly that the whole thing was the result of a plot
by the Elders of Zion and that Kaplan's Delicatessen&mdash;in conspiracy
with A Cohen, Notions&mdash;was at the bottom of the grass.
Brother Paul wrote&mdash;and his letter was printed, for he now
advertised his radioprograms in the columns of the <i>Intelligencer</i>&mdash;that
Caesar&mdash;presumably the state of California&mdash;had
been chastened for arrogating to itself things not to be rendered
unto Caesar and the tankmen had deservedly perished
for their sacrilege. The letter aroused fury&mdash;the followers of
Brother Paul either didnt read the <i>Intelligencer</i> or were satisfied
their leader needed no championing, if they did&mdash;and
other letters poured in calling for various expressions of popular
disapproval, from simple boycott up through tarring and
feathering to plain and elaborated&mdash;with gasoline and castration&mdash;lynching.
The grass was a hot topic.</p>

<p>With its acute perception of the popular taste Le ffa&ccedil;as&eacute;'s
paper printed not only most of the communications&mdash;the unprintable
ones were circulated among the staff till they wore
out or disappeared mysteriously in the Gents Room&mdash;but maps
showing the daily progress of the weed, guesses as to the duration
of the plague by local prophets, learned articles by scientists,
opinions of statesmen, views of prominent entertainers,
in fact anything having any remote connection with the topic
of the day. The paper even went further and offered a reward
of ten thousand dollars to anyone advancing a suggestion leading
to the destruction of the intruder. Its circulation jumped
at the expense of less perspicacious rivals and the incoming
mail, already many times normal, swelled to staggering proportions.</p>

<p>The contest was taken with deadly seriousness, for the livelihood
of many of the paper's readers was suddenly threatened<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
by its subject and from a new quarter. In the same issue as
the offered reward there appeared an interview with the accredited
head of the organized motionpicture producers. This
retiring gentleman was rumored to be completely illiterate,
an unquestionable slander, for he had written checks to support
every cause dedicated to keeping wages where they belonged
and seeing the wage earners didnt waste the money so
benevolently supplied by their employers.</p>

<p>I got the details of the interview from the interviewer himself.
The magnate&mdash;he had no objection to the description&mdash;had
been irritable and minced no words. The grass was bad
alike for production and boxoffice, taking everyone's mind off
the prime business of making and viewing motionpictures. It
was injuring The Industry and he couldnt conceal the fact that
The Industry, speaking through his mouth and with his vocabulary,
was annoyed.</p>

<p>"Unless this disgraceful episode ends within ten days," he
had said sternly, "the Motion Picture Industry will move to
Florida."</p>

<p>It was an ultimatum; Southern Californians heard and trembled.
The last time this dread interdiction had been invoked&mdash;in
the midst of a bitter election fight&mdash;it had sent them scurrying
to the polls to do their benefactor's bidding. Now indeed
the grass menace would be taken seriously.</p>

<p>The next day's paper had news of more immediate concern
to me. The governor had appointed a special committee to
investigate the situation and the first two witnesses to be called
were Josephine Spencer Francis and Albert Weener.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">20.</span> <span class="num2">W</span>illiam Rufus Le ffa&ccedil;as&eacute; was as
enthusiastic as his phlegmatic nature permitted. He called me
into his office and half raised the snuffbox off the desk as
though to offer me an unwelcome pinch. "Youre a made man
now, Weener," he said, thinking better of his generosity and
putting the snuffbox back. "Your name will be in headlines
from Alabama to Alberta&mdash;and all due to the <i>Intelligencer</i>."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>I would have resented this as a gross misappropriation of
credit&mdash;for surely all obligation was on the other side&mdash;had I
not been deeply disturbed by the prospect of being haled before
this committee like a criminal before the bar of justice.</p>

<p>"I'd much rather avoid this unpleasant notoriety, Mr. Le
ffa&ccedil;as&eacute;," I protested. "Since the <i>Intelligencer</i>, for reasons best
known to itself, chooses not to avail itself of my contributions,
but prints my name over words I have not written, there could
be no possible objection to my slipping away to Nevada until
this investigation ends."</p>

<p>His face became a pretty shade of plum. "Weener, youre a
thief, a petty, cadging, sly, larcenous, pilfering, bloody thief.
You take the <i>Daily Intelligencer</i>'s honest dollars without a
qualm, aye, with a smirk on your imbecile face, proposing with
the cool impudence of the born embezzler to return no value
for them. Weener, you forget yourself. The <i>Intelligencer</i>
picked you out of a gutter, a nauseous, dungspattered and
thoroughly fitting gutter, and pays you well, mark that, you
feebleminded counterfeit of a confidenceman, pays you well,
not for your futile, lecherous pawings at the chastity of the
English language, but out of the boundless generosity which
only a newspaper with a great soul can have. And what do
you propose to do in gratitude? To run, to flee, to hide from
the expression of authority, to bring disgrace upon the very
newspaper whose munificence pumps life into your boneless,
soulless, gutless carcass. Not another word, not a sound, not a
ghoulish syllable from your ineffective vocabulary. Out of my
presence before I lose my temper. Get down to whatever
smokefilled and tastelessly decorated room that committee is
meeting in and do not leave while it is in session, neither to
eat, sleep, nor move those bowels whose possession I gravely
doubt. You hear me, Weener?"</p>

<p>For some reason the committee was not attempting to get
the story of the grass in chronological order. When I arrived,
the six distinguished gentlemen were trying to find out all
about the crudeoil poured, apparently without effect, in what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
now seemed so long ago, but which actually had been less than
two weeks before.</p>

<p>Flanked on either side by his colleagues, the little black
plug of his hearingaid sticking out like a misplaced unicorn's
horn, was the chairman, Senator Jones, his looseskinned old
fingers resting lightly on the bright table, the nails square and
ridged, the flesh brownspotted. He adjusted a pair of goldrimmed
spectacles, quickly found the improvement in his
vision unpleasant, and rumbled, "What did it cost the taxpayers?"</p>

<p>On the stand, the chief of police was settled in great discomfort,
so far forward on the rounded edge of his chair that
his balance was a source of fascinated speculation to the gallery.
He squirmed a perilous half inch forward, but before
he had time to reply, old Judge Robinson of the State Supreme
Court, who scorned any palliation of his deafness
such as Senator Jones condescended to, cupped his left ear
with his hand and shrieked, "Ay? Ay? What's that? Speak up,
can't you? Don't sit there mumbling."</p>

<p>Assemblyman Brown, head of the legislature's antiracketeering
committee, intense concentration expressed in the forward
push of his vigorous shoulders and the creased lines on his
youthful forehead, asked if it were not true that the oil had
been held up by a union jurisdictional dispute? There was a
spattering of applause from the listeners at this adroit question
and one man in the back of the room cried "Sha&mdash;" and
then sat down quickly.</p>

<p>Attorney General Smith wanted to know just who had
ordered the oil in the first place and whether the propertyowners
had given their consent to its application. The attorney
general's square face, softened and rounded by fat, shone on
the wriggling chief like a klieglight; his lips, irresistibly suggesting
twin slices of underdone steak, parting into a pleasant
smile when his question had concluded. The other two members
of the committee seemed about to inquire further when
the chief managed to stammer, he was awfully sorry, gentlemen,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
but he had been out of town and hadnt even heard of
the oil till this moment.</p>

<p>He was instantly dismissed from the stand and a new witness,
from the mayor's office, was called, with no happier results.
He, too, was about to be excused when Dr Johnson, who
represented Science on the committee, descended from Himalayan
abstraction to demand what effect the oil had had on
the grass.</p>

<p>There were excited whisperings and craning of feminine
heads as Dr Johnson propounded his question. The interest
he excited was, however, largely vicarious. For he was famous,
not so much in his own right, as in being the husband of the
<i>Intelligencer</i>'s widely read society columnist whose malapropisms
caused more wry enjoyment and fearsome anticipation
than an elopement to Nevada.</p>

<p>"And what effect did the oil have on the grass?" he repeated.</p>

<p>The query caused confusion, for it seemed the committee
could not proceed until this fact had been ascertained. Various
technicians were sent for, and the doctor, tall, solemn and
benign, looked over his stiff, turned-down collar and the black
string tie drooping around it, as though searching for some
profound truth which would be readily apparent to him
alone.</p>

<p>The experts discoursed at some length in esoteric terms&mdash;one
even bringing a portable blackboard on which he demonstrated,
with diagrams, the chemical, geologic and mathematical
aspects of the problem&mdash;but no pertinent information
was forthcoming till some minor clerk in the Department of
Water and Power, who had only got to the stand through a
confusion of names, said boldly, "No effect whatever."</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked Judge Robinson. "Was the oil adulterated?
Speak up, speak up; don't mumble."</p>

<p>Henry Miller, the Southland's bestknown realtor ("Los
Angeles First in Population by Nineteen Ninety Nine"), who
had connections in the oil industry, as well as in citrus and
walnut packing, frowned disapprovingly. The clerk said he
didnt know, but he might venture a guess<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>Senator Jones informed him majestically that the committee
was concerned with facts, not speculations. This created an
impasse until Attorney General Smith tactfully suggested the
clerk might be permitted to guess, entirely off the record. After
the official stenographer had been commanded sternly not to
take down a single word of conjecture, the witness was allowed
to advance the opinion that the oil hadnt killed the plant
because it had never reached the roots.</p>

<p>"Ay?" questioned the learned judge, looking as though
neither his lunch nor breakfast nor, for that matter, any
nourishment absorbed since the Taft administration, had
agreed with him.</p>

<p>"I'm a bit of a gardener myself, gentlemen," the witness assured
them confidentially, settling back comfortably. "I putter
around my own place Saturdays and Sundays and I know what
devilgrass is like. I can well imagine a bunch of it twenty or
twentyfive feet high could be coated with many, many gallons
of oil without a drop seeping down into the ground."</p>

<p>Mr Miller said magisterially, "Not really good American
oil," but no one paid attention, knowing that he was commenting,
not as a member of the committee, but in his other capacity
as the head of an organization to promote Brotherhood and
Democracy by deporting all foreignborn and the descendants
of foreignborn to their original countries. Everyone was only
too happy to have the oil matter concluded at any cost; and
after the stenographer was ordered to resume his labors, the
next witness was called.</p>

<p>"Albert Weener!"</p>

<p>I hope I may never again have to submit to the scrutiny of
twelve such merciless eyes. I cast my own down at the brown
linoleum until every stain and inkspot was impressed ineradicably
on my mind. Senator Jones finally broke the tension
by asking, "What is your name?"</p>

<p>Judge Robinson enjoined, "Speak up, speak up. Don't
mumble."</p>

<p>"Albert Weener," I replied.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a faint sigh through the room. Everyone who read
the <i>Daily Intelligencer</i> had heard of me.</p>

<p>"And what is your occupation, Mr Weener?" asked Henry
Miller.</p>

<p>"Salesman, sir," I answered automatically, forgetting my
present connection with the newspaper, and he smiled at me
sympathetically.</p>

<p>"You belong to a socalled tradesunion?" inquired Assemblyman
Brown.</p>

<p>"I will ask the honorable Mr Brown to modify his question
by having the word 'socalled' struck from it."</p>

<p>"I will inform the honorable attorney general that my question
stands exactly as I phrased it," rejoined Assemblyman
Brown sharply. "I'll remind the attorney general I myself am
a member in good standing of a legitimate union, namely the
International Brotherhood of Embalmers, Morticians, Gravediggers
and Helpers, and when I asked the witness if he belonged
to a socalled tradesunion I was referring to any one of
those groups of Red conspirators who attempt to strangle the
economic body by interfering with the normal course of business
and mulcting honest citizens of tributary dues before they
can pursue their livelihoods."</p>

<p>Judge Robinson cupped his ear again and glared at me.
"Speak up man; stop mumbling."</p>

<p>"I don't belong to any union," I answered as soon as there
was a chance for my words to be heard. Senator Jones took a
notebook from his pocket, consulted it, put it back, scribbled
something on the pad in front of him, tore it up, looked at his
notebook again and asked, "What is your connection with this
... um ... grass?"</p>

<p>"I applied Miss Francis' Metamorphizer to it, sir," I answered.</p>

<p>"Nonsense," said Judge Robinson sharply.</p>

<p>"Explain yourself," demanded Attorney General Smith.</p>

<p>"Tell us just what this stuff is and how you applied it,"
suggested Henry Miller.</p>

<p>"Don't mumble," ordered Judge Robinson.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm sorry, gentlemen, I don't know exactly what it is. Youll
have to ask Miss Francis that. But&mdash;"</p>

<p>Senator Jones interrupted me. "You mean to say you applied
a chemical to someone's lawn, a piece of valuable property,
without knowing its contents?" he asked sternly.</p>

<p>"Well, Senator&mdash;&mdash;" I began.</p>

<p>"Do you habitually act in this irresponsible manner?"</p>

<p>"Senator, I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't you understand, sir, that consequences necessarily
follow actions? What sort of world would this be if everyone
rushed around blindly using things of whose nature they were
completely unaware?"</p>

<p>"Don't mumble," warned Judge Robinson.</p>

<p>I began to feel very low indeed and could only say haltingly,
"I acted in good faith, gentlemen," when Mr Miller
kindly recommended that I be excused since I had evidently
given all the information at my command.</p>

<p>"Subject to recall," growled Attorney General Smith.</p>

<p>"Oh, certainly, sir, certainly," agreed Mr Miller, and I was
thankfully released from my ordeal.</p>

<p>"Josephine Spencer Francis."</p>

<p>I cannot say Miss Francis had made any concessions in her
appearance in deference to the committee, for she looked as
though she had come straight from her kitchen, a suspicion
strengthened by the strand of grass she carried in her fingers
and played with absently throughout. She appeared quite at
home as she settled herself in the chair, scanning with the
greatest interest the faces of the committeemen as if she were
memorizing each feature for future reference.</p>

<p>The honorable body returned her scrutiny with sharply individual
emphasis. The attorney general smiled pleasantly at
her; Judge Robinson looked more sour than ever and grunted,
"Woman; mistake"; Senator Jones bowed toward her with
courtesy; Assemblyman Brown gave her a sharp onceover; Mr
Miller pursed his lips in amusement; and Dr Johnson gazed at
her in horrified fascination.</p>

<p>Senator Jones bowed for a second time and inquired her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
name. He received the information and chewed it meditatively.
Miss Francis took out her gold toothpick, considered
the etiquette of using it and regretfully put it away in time
to hear the attorney general's question, "Mrs or Miss Francis?"</p>

<p>"Miss," she replied gruffly. "<i>Virgo intacta.</i>"</p>

<p>Senator Jones drew back as if attacked by a wasp. Attorney
General Smith said, "Hum," very loudly and looked at Assemblyman
Brown who looked blank. Dr Johnson's nose raised
itself a perceptible inch and Judge Robinson, sensing a sensation
among his colleagues, shouted, "Speak up, madam, don't
mumble."</p>

<p>Mr. Miller, who hadnt been affected, inquired, "What is
your occupation, Miss Francis?"</p>

<p>"Agrostological engineer, specializing in chemical research."</p>

<p>"How's that again?" Judge Robinson managed to put into
the simple gesture of cupping his ear a devastating condemnation
of Miss Francis, women in general, science and presentday
society. She politely repeated herself.</p>

<p>"Astrology&mdash;what's that got to do with the grass? Do you
cast horoscopes?"</p>

<p>"Agrostology," Dr Johnson murmured to the ceiling.</p>

<p>"Will you explain please in simpler terms, just what you
do?" requested Attorney General Smith.</p>

<p>"Local statutes against fortunetelling," burst out Judge
Robinson.</p>

<p>"I have spent my life studying reactions of plants to the
lighter elements and the effects of certain compounds on their
growth, reproduction, and metabolism."</p>

<p>Judge Robinson removed his hand from behind his ear and
rubbed his skull irritably. Assemblyman Brown complained,
"There's entirely too much talk about reaction." Dr Johnson
inspected a paneled wall with no interest whatever and Senator
Jones stated pontifically, "You are an agricultural chemist."</p>

<p>Miss Francis smiled at him amiably. "Agriculture is a broad
field and I farm one small corner of it."</p>

<p>Attorney General Smith leaned forward with interest.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
"From what university did you obtain your degrees, Miss
Francis?"</p>

<p>She slouched back comfortably, to look more cylindrical
than ever. "None," she stated baldly.</p>

<p>"Hay? ... mumble!"</p>

<p>Senator Jones said, "I'm afraid I did not quite understand
your reply, madam."</p>

<p>"I hold no degrees, honors, or diplomas whatever, and I have
not wasted one second of my life in any college, university,
academy, or other alleged institution of learning. The degrees
good enough for Roger Bacon, Erasmus Darwin, Lavoisier,
Linnaeus and Lamarck are good enough for me. I am a questioner,
gentlemen, a learner, not a collector of alphabetical
letters which, strung together in any form your fancy pleases,
continue eternally to spell nothing whatever."</p>

<p>Sensation. One of the experts who had been waiting patiently
to testify, folded his arms and said in a loud voice, "This
is what comes of tolerating women in the professions." Another
muttered, "Charlatan ... ridiculous ... dangerous
thing ... shameful ... sex ..." Two elderly ladies in
broadcloth coats with fur collars, later identified as crusaders
for antivivisection, cheered feebly and were promptly ejected.</p>

<p>Senator Jones took off his spectacles, polished them exhaustively,
tried to put them on upside down, gave up and
stated gravely, "This is an extraordinary admission, Miss, um,
Francis."</p>

<p>"It is not an admission at all; it is a statement of fact. As for
its irregularity, I take the liberty of believing we unlettered
ones are in the majority rather than minority."</p>

<p>Judge Robinson warned, "Could be cited for contempt, Miss
Harrumph."</p>

<p>Dr Johnson said sharply, "Nonsense, madam, even a&mdash;even
a tree surgeon has more respect for learning."</p>

<p>Mr Miller leaned slightly over the table. "Do you realize that
in your ignorant dabbling you have ruined hundreds of
propertyowners and taxpayers?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>"I thought there was some law against practicing without a
license," speculated Assemblyman Brown.</p>

<p>"There is apparently no law applying intelligence qualifications
for members of the legislature," remarked Miss Francis
pleasantly.</p>

<p>Senator Jones lifted his gavel, idle until now, and banged
it on the table, smashing his spectacles thoughtlessly placed in
front of him a moment before. This did nothing to appease his
rising choler. "Silence, madam! We have perhaps been too
lenient in deference to your, um, sex. I'll remind you that this
body is vested with all the dignity of the state of California.
Unless you apologize instantly I shall cite you for contempt."</p>

<p>"I beg the committee's pardon."</p>

<p>The investigators held a whispered conference among themselves,
evidently to determine whether this equivocal apology
was to be accepted. Apparently it was, for Dr Johnson now
asked loftily and with an abstracted air, as though he already
knew the answer and considered it beneath notice, "What was
this magic formula you caused to be put on the grass?"</p>

<p>Malicious spirits averred that Dickie Johnson had flunked
out of agricultural school, had an obscure European diploma,
and that his fame as a professor at Creighton University was
based on the gleaming granite and stainless steel building dedicated
to research in agronomy which bore the legend "Johnson
Foundation" over the entrance. No one hearing him pronounce
"magic formula" putting into the word all the contempt
of the scientist for the quack, could ever put credence
in the base slander. "What was this 'magic formula' you
caused to be put on the grass?" he repeated.</p>

<p>Miss Francis reeled off a list of elements so swiftly I'm sure
no one but the stenographer caught them all. I know I didnt
get more than half, though I was sitting less than five feet from
her. "Magnesium," she stated, "iodine, carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen,
helium, potash, sulphur, oxygen ..."</p>

<p>Dr Johnson seemed to have known its composition since
grammarschool days. Senator Jones asked, "And what effect
did you expect this extraordinary conglomeration to have?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>She repeated what she had told me at first and the deductions
she had made since. Dr Johnson smiled. "A true Man of
Science," he stated, "one who has labored for years to acquire
those degrees you affect to despise, would have been trained in
selfless devotion to the service of mankind, would never have
made whatever gross error your ignorance, heightened by projection
into a sphere for which you are probably biologically
unfitted&mdash;though this is perhaps controversial&mdash;has betrayed
you into. For had you freely shared your work with colleagues
they would have been able to correct your mistakes and this
catastrophe brought on by selfish greed&mdash;a catastrophe which
has already cost millions&mdash;would not have occurred."</p>

<p>The entire committee, including Dr Johnson himself,
seemed pleased with this indictment. Attorney General Smith
looked inquiringly at the witness as though inviting her to
answer <i>that</i> if she could. Miss Francis evidently took the invitation
literally, for she addressed herself directly to Dr Johnson.</p>

<p>"I do not know, Doctor, where these beautiful and eminently
sensible ideals you have so eloquently outlined are
practiced, where scientists, regardless of biological fitness,
share with each other their advances from moment to moment
and so add to the security of civilization from day to day. Is it
in the great research foundations whose unlimited funds are
used to lure promising young men to their staffs, much as
athletes used to be given scholarships by universities anxious
to improve the physical qualities of American youth? Is it in
the experimental laboratories of great industries where technological
advances are daily suppressed, locked away in safes,
so profits may not be diminished by the expensive retooling
necessary to put these advances into effect? Or is it in a field
closer to my own, in chemical research&mdash;pure science, if you
like&mdash;where truly secrets are shared on an international scale
in order to build up the cartels which choke production by
increasing prices and promote those industries which thrive
on international illwill?"</p>

<p>Assemblyman Brown rose to his feet and said in measured<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
tones, "This woman is a paid agent of the Communist International.
I have heard such rantings from demagogues on
streetcorners. I demand the committee listen to no more of this
propaganda."</p>

<p>Mr Miller gave a polite wave of his hand toward the assemblyman,
indicating at once full agreement with what the
legislator said and apology for pursuing his questioning of
Miss Francis. He then asked the witness sternly, "What is your
real name?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I don't quite understand. The only name I have
is Josephine Spencer Francis and so far as I know it is thus
written on my birth certificate."</p>

<p>"Birth certificate, ay? Where were you born? Speak up, don't
mumble."</p>

<p>"Russia, without a doubt," muttered Assemblyman Brown.</p>

<p>"Youre sure it isnt Franciski or Franciscovitch? Or say, Finklestein?"</p>

<p>"My name is not Finkelstein, although I do not find myself
terrified of that combination of syllables. I was born in Moscow&mdash;"</p>

<p>Another sensation. "I thought so!" screamed Judge Robinson
triumphantly.</p>

<p>"Aha!" exclaimed Senator Jones profoundly.</p>

<p>"The leopard doesnt change his spots or the Red his (or her)
color," asserted Assemblyman Brown.</p>

<p>"A sabatoor," yelled several of the spectators. Only Dr Johnson
seemed unimpressed with the revelation; he smiled contentedly.</p>

<p>"&mdash;in Moscow, Idaho," concluded Miss Francis, picking her
teeth with a flourish.</p>

<p>Judge Robinson screeched, "Ay? Ay? What's all this hubbub?"
Assemblyman Brown sneered, "A very unlikely story."
Attorney General Smith wanted it proven in blackandwhite
while Senator Jones remarked Miss Francis' taste was on a level
with her scholarship.</p>

<p>She waved the toothpick toward the chairman and politely
waited for either further questions or dismissal. All the while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
her intense interest in each gesture of the inquisitors and every
facet of the investigation had not diminished at all. As she sat
there patiently, her eyes darted from one to the other as they
consulted and only came to rest on Senator Jones when he
spoke directly to her again.</p>

<p>"And what steps can you take to undo, hum, this?"</p>

<p>"So far, none," admitted Miss Francis, "but since this thing
has happened I have given all my time to experiment hoping
in some manner to reverse the action of the Metamorphizer
and evolve a formula whereby the growth it induced will be
inhibited. I cannot say I am even on the right road yet, for you
must recall I have spent my adult life going, as it were, in one
direction and it is now not a matter of merely retracing my
steps, but of starting out for an entirely different destination
in a field where there are no highwaymaps and few compasspoints.
I cannot say I am even optimistic of success, but it is not
for want of trying&mdash;be assured of that."</p>

<p>Another semisilence while the committee conferred once
more. Finally Senator Jones spoke in grave and measured
tones: "It is a customary politeness in hearings of this nature
to thank the witness for his helpfulness and cooperation. This
courtesy I cannot with any sincerity extend to you, madam. It
seems to me you have proven yourself the opposite of a good
citizen, that you have set yourself up, in your arrogance, against
all logical authority and have presumed to look down upon the
work and methods of men whose standing and ways of procedure
are recognized by all sound people. By your conceit,
madam, you have caused the death of young men, the flower of
our state's manhood, who gave their lives in a vain attempt to
destroy what your ignorance created. If I may be permitted a
rather daring and perhaps harsh aside, I think this should
strike you doubly, as a woman who has not brought forth offspring
to carry on the work of our forefathers and as one who&mdash;with
doubtful taste&mdash;boasts of that sterility. I think the results
of your socalled experiments should chasten you and make you
heed the words of men properly qualified in a field where you
are clearly not so."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>Someone in the back of the room applauded the senator's
eloquence.</p>

<p>"Senator Jones," said Miss Francis, turning her eyes on him
with the attention I knew so well, the look which meant she
had found an interest for the moment excluding all others,
"you accuse me of what amounts to crime or at least criminal
folly and I must answer that your accusations are at once both
true and false. I have been foolish, but it was not in despising
the constrictions and falsity of the academic world. I <i>have</i>
flouted authority, but it was not the authority of the movingpicture
heroes, whose comic errors are perpetuated for generations,
like those of Pasteur, or so quietly repudiated their
repudiation passes unnoticed, like those of Lister, in order to
protect a vested interest. The authority I have flouted, in my
arrogance as you call it, is that authority all scientists recognized
in the days when science was scientific and called itself,
not boastfully by the name of all knowledge, but more humbly
and decently, natural philosophy. That authority is what theologians
term the Will of God; others, the life force, the immaterial
principle, the common unconscious, or whatever you
will. When I, along with all the academic robots whom you
admire, denied that authority, we did not make ourselves, as
we thought, men of pure science, but, on the contrary, by deposing
one master we invited in a horde of others. Since we
could not submit to moral force we submitted in our blind
stupidity&mdash;we called it the rejection of metaphysical concepts&mdash;to
financial force, to political force, to social force; and finally,
since there was no longer any reward in itself for our speculations,
we submitted to the lust for personal aggrandizement in
fortune, in notoriety, in castebound irresponsibility, and even
for the hypocritical backslapping of our fellows.</p>

<p>"In the counterrevolution known as the nineteenth century
we even repudiated the name of speculation and it became a
term of disrepute, like metaphysical. We went further than a
mere disavowal of the name; we disavowed the whole process
and turned with disgust from the using of our minds to the use
of our hands in a manner which would have revolted the most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
illiterate of Carpathian peasants. We extirpated the salivary
glands of dogs in order to find out if they would slobber without
them. We cut off the tails of mice to discover if the operation
affected their greatgrandchildren. We decapitated, emasculated,
malnourished, and poisoned rodents against whom we
had no personal animus for no other reason than to keep an
elaborate apparatus in use.</p>

<p>"Even these pastimes failed to satisfy our undiscriminating
appetite. Someone a little stupider, a little less imaginative&mdash;though
such conditions must have been difficult indeed to
achieve&mdash;invented what is called the Control Experiment
whereby, if theory tested be correct, half the subjects are condemned
without trial to execution.</p>

<p>"These are my sins: that in despising academic ends I did not
despise academic means, that in repudiating the brainlessness
of the professorial mind I did not attempt to use my own. Because
I was proud of the integrity which made me choose not
to do the will of a research foundation or industrial empire,
I overlooked the vital fact that I had also chosen not to do
God's Will, but what I stupidly thought to be my own. It was
not. It was faintheartedness, sloth, placation, doubt, vagueness
and romantical misconception. In a word, it was the aimlessness
and falsity of the nineteenth century coming back in the
window after having been booted out the door; my folly was
the failure to recognize it. I have deluded myself, I have taken
halfmeasures, I have followed false paths. Condemn me for
these crimes. I am guilty."</p>

<p>Attorney General Smith said acidly, "This is neither a psychiatrist's
consulting room, a confessional, nor a court of law.
I suggest the witness be excused and her last hysterical remarks
expunged from the record."</p>

<p>"It is so ordered," ruled Senator Jones. "And now, gentlemen,
we shall recess until tomorrow."</p>

<h3>Man Triumphant ... I</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">21.</span> <span class="num2">T</span>he hearings of the Committee to
Investigate Dangerous Vegetation went on for five days and
Mr Le ffa&ccedil;as&eacute; was increasingly delighted as the proceedings
went down, properly edited and embellished to excite reader
interest, in the columns of the <i>Daily Intelligencer</i>. He even
unbent so far as to call me a fool without any adjectival modification,
which was for him the height of geniality.</p>

<p>I don't want to give the impression the committee stole the
show, as the saying goes. The show essentially and primarily
was still the grass itself. It grew while the honorable body inquired
and it grew while the honorable body, tired by its labors,
slept. It increased during the speeches of Senator Jones,
through the interjections of Judge Robinson, and as Dr Johnson
added his wisdom to the deliberations.</p>

<p>While the committee probed, listened and digested, the
grass finally pushed its way across Hollywood Boulevard, resisting
frantic efforts by the National Guard, the fire and police
departments, and a volunteer brigade of local merchants, to
stem its course. It defied alike sharpened steel, fire, chemicals
and explosives. Even the smallest runner could now be severed
only with the greatest difficulty, for in its advance the weed had
toughened&mdash;some said because of its omnivorous diet, others,
its ability to absorb nitrogen from the air&mdash;and its rubbery
quality caused it to yield to onslaught only to bound back,
apparently uninjured, after each blow.</p>

<p>One of the most disquieting aspects of the advance was its
variability and unpredictability. To the west, it had hardly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
gone five blocks from the Dinkman house, while southward it
had crossed Santa Monica Boulevard and was nosing toward
Melrose. Its growth had been measured and checked, over and
over again, but the figures were never constant. Some days it
traveled a foot an hour; on others it leapt nearly a city block
between sunrise and nightfall.</p>

<p>It is simple to put down "the grass crossed Hollywood Boulevard";
as simple as saying, "our troops advanced" or "the man
was hanged at dawn." But when I write these words less than
a generation later, surrounded by rolling hills, gentle brooks,
and vast lawns sedate and tame, I can close my eyes and see
again the green glacier crawling down the sidestreets and over
the low roofs of the shops to pour like a cascade upon the busy
artery.</p>

<p>Once more I can feel the crawling of my skin as I looked
upon the methodical obliteration of men's work. I can see the
tendrils splaying out over the sidewalks, choking the roadways,
climbing walls, finding vulnerable chinks in masonry, bunching
themselves inside apertures and bursting out, carrying with
them fragments of their momentary prison as they pursued
their ruthless course.</p>

<p>Now the uproar and clamor of a disturbed public swelled to
giant volume. All the disruption and distress going before had
been news; this was disaster. "All same Glauman's Chinese, all
same Pa'thenon," remarked Gootes, and indeed I have heard
far less outcry over the destruction of historic landmarks than
was raised when the grass obscured the celebrated footprints.</p>

<p>Recall of the mayor was demanded and councilmen's official
limousines were frequently overturned. Meetings denounced
the inaction of the authorities; a gigantic parade bearing placards
calling for an end to procrastination marched past the
cityhall. Democrats blamed Republicans for inefficiency and
Republicans retorted that Miss Francis had done her research
during a Democratic administration.</p>

<p>Every means previously tried and found wanting was tried
again as though it were impossible for human minds to acknowledge
defeat by an insensate plant. The axes, the scythes,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
weedburners and reapers were brought out again, only to
prove their inability to cope with the relentless flow of the
grass. Robot tanks loaded with explosives disappeared as had
those containing the soldiers, and only the stifled sound of their
explosion registered the fact that they had fulfilled their design
if not their purpose.</p>

<p>It was difficult for the man on the street to understand how
the weapons successful in Normandy and Tarawa could be
balked by vegetation. Like the Investigating Committee's pursuit
of the question of the crudeoil's adulteration, they wanted
to know if the tanks were firstline vehicles or some surplus
palmed off by the War Department; if the weedburners were
properly accredited graminicides or just a bunch of bums
taken from the reliefrolls. The necessary reverse of this picture
was the jubilant hailing of each new instrument of attack, the
brief but hysterical enthusiasm for each in turn as the ultimate
savior.</p>

<p>Because of my unique position I witnessed the trial of them
all. I saw tanks dragging rotary plows and others equipped
with devices like electricfans but with blades of hardened steel
sharpened to razor keenness. The only thing this latter gadget
did was to scatter more potential nuclei to the accommodating
wind.</p>

<p>I saw the Flammenwerfer, the dreadful flamethrowers which
had scorched the bodies of men like burnt toast in an instant,
direct their concentrated fire upon the advancing runners. I
smelled the sweetly sick smell of steaming sap and saw the runners
shrivel and curl back as they had done on other occasions,
until nothing was presented to the flamethrowers except the
tangled mass of interwoven stems denuded of all foliage. Upon
this involved wall the fire had no effect, the stems did not wilt,
the hard membranes did not collapse, the steely network did
not retreat. It seemed a drawn battle in one small sector, yet
in that very part where the grass paused on the ground it rose
higher into the air like a poising tidalwave. Higher and higher,
until its crest, unbalanced, toppled forward to engulf its tormentors.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the unruffled advance resumed, again some resource
was interposed against it, again it was checked for an instant
and again it overcame its adversary, careless of obstacles, impartially
taking to itself gouty roominghouses and pimping
frenchprovincial ("17 master bedrooms") chateaus, hotdogstand
and Brown Derby, cornergrocery and pyramidal foodmart;
undeterred by anything in its path.</p>

<p>When you say a clump of weed attacked a city you utter an
absurdity. I think everyone was aware of the fantastic discrepancy
between statement of the event and the event itself. So
innocent and ridiculous the grass looked as it made its first
tentative thrust at the urban nerves; the green blades sloped
forward like some prettily arranged but unimaginative corsage
upon the concrete bosom of the street. You could not believe
those fragile seeming strands would resist the impress of a careless
boot, much less the entire arsenal of military and agricultural
implements. It must have been this deceptive fragility
which broke the spirit of so many people.</p>

<p>From an item in the <i>Intelligencer</i> I recalled the existence of
one of Mrs Dinkman's neighbors who had rudely refused the
opportunity to have his lawn treated with the Metamorphizer.
He had left an incoherent suicidenote: "Pigeons in the grass
alas. Too many pigeons, too much grass. Pigeons are doves, but
Noah expressed a raven. Contradiction lies. Roses are red,
violets are blue. The grass is green and I am thru. Too too too.
Darling kiddies." He then, in full view of the helpless weedfighters,
marched on into the grass and was lost to sight.</p>

<p>In the days following, so many selfdestructions succeeded
this one that the grass became known in the papers as the
Green Horror. Perhaps a peculiar sidelight on human oddity
was revealed in most of these suicides choosing to immolate
themselves, not in the main body of the grass, but in one of the
many smaller nuclei springing up in close proximity.</p>

<p>It was my fortune to witness the confluence of two of these
descendant bodies. They had come into being only a few blocks
apart; understandably their true character was unrecognized
until they were out of control and had enveloped the neighborhoods<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
of their origin. They crept toward each other with a
sort of incestuous attraction until mere yards separated them;
they paused skittishly, the runners crawled forward speculatively,
the green fronds began overlapping like clasping fingers,
then with accelerating speed came together much as a
pack of cards in the hands of a deft shuffler slides edge under
edge to make a compact and indivisible whole. The line of
division disappeared, the two became one, and where before
there had been left a narrow path for men to tread, now only
a serene line of vegetation outlined itself against the unblinking
sky.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">22.</span> <span class="num2">I</span> have said Mr Le ffa&ccedil;as&eacute; had softened
his brutality toward me, but his favor did not extend&mdash;so pervasive
is literary jealousy&mdash;to printing my own reports. He
continued to subject me to the indignity of being "ghosted,"
a thoroughly expressive term, which by a combination of bad
conjugation and the suggestion of insubstantiality defines the
sort of prose produced, by Jacson Gootes. This arrangement,
instead of giving me some freedom, shackled me to the reporter,
who dashed from celebrity to celebrity, grass to nuclei,
office to point of momentary interest, with unflagging energy
and infuriating jocosity. I knew his repertory of tricks and
accents down to the last yawn.</p>

<p>Most of all I resented his irregular habits. He never arrived
at the <i>Intelligencer</i> office on time or quit after a proper day's
work. He thought nothing of getting me out of bed before I'd
had my eight hours' sleep to accompany him on some ridiculous
errand. "Bertie, old dormouse, the grass is knocking at the
doors of NBC."</p>

<p>"All right," I answered, annoyed. "It started down Vine
Street yesterday. It would be more surprising if it obligingly
paused before the studios."</p>

<p>"Cynic," he said, pulling the bedclothes away from my face.
I consider this the lowest form of horseplay I know of. "How
quickly your ideals have been tarnished by contact with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
vulgar world of newspaperdom. Front and center, Bertie lad,
we must catch the grass making its own soundeffects before
they jerk out the microphones."</p>

<p>Protests having no effect I reluctantly went with him, but
the scene was merely a repetition of hundreds of previous ones,
the grass being no more or less spectacular for NBC than for
Watanabe's Nursery and Cut Flower Shop a halfmile away. Its
aftereffects, however, were immediate. The governor declared
martial law in Los Angeles County and ordered the evacuation
of an area five miles wide on the perimeter of the grass.</p>

<p>Furious cries of anguish went up from those affected by the
arbitrary order. What authority had any official to dispossess
honest people from their homes in times of peace? The right to
hold their property unmolested was a prerogative vested in the
humblest American and who was the governor to abrogate the
Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, and manifold
decisions of the Supreme Court? In embittered fury Henry
Miller resigned from the Investigating Committee, now defunct
anyway, its voluminous and inconclusive report buried
in the state archives. Injunctions issued from local courts like
ashes from a stirring volcano, but the militia were impervious
and hustled the freeholders from their homes with callous disregard
for the sacred dues of property.</p>

<p>When the reason behind this evacuation order leaked out a
still greater lamentation was evoked, for the National Guard
was planning nothing less than a saturation incendiary bombing
of the entire area. The bludgeon which reduced the cities
of Europe to mere shells must surely destroy this new invader.
Even the stoutest defenders of property conceded this must be
so&mdash;but what was the point of annihilating the enemy if their
holdings were to be sacrificed in the process? No, no, let the
governor take whatever means he pleased to dispatch the weed
so long as the method involved left them homes to enjoy when
things were&mdash;as they inevitably must be&mdash;restored to normal.
So frantic were their efforts that the Supreme Court actually
forced the governor to postpone his proposed bombing, though
it did not discontinue the evacuation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>There were few indeed who understood how the weed would
digest the very wood, bricks or stucco and who packed up and
moved out ahead of the troops. American flags and shotguns
recalled the heroic days of the frontier, and defiance of the governor's
edict was the rule instead of the exception. Fierce old
ladies dared the militiamen to lay a finger on them or their possessions
and apoplectic gentlemen, eyes as glazed as those of
the huntingtrophies on their walls, sputtered refusals to stir,
no, not for all the brutal force in the world. No one was seriously
hurt in this rebellion, the commonest wound being long
scratches on the cheeks of the guardsmen, inflicted by feminine
nails, as with various degrees of resistance the inhabitants were
carried or shooed from their dwellings.</p>

<p>While the wrangling over its destruction went on, the grass
continued its progress. Out through Cahuenga Pass it flowed,
toward fertile San Fernando Valley. Steadily it climbed to the
hilltops, masticating sage, greasewood, oak, sycamore and manzanita
with the same ease it bolted houses and pavements. Into
Griffith Park it swaggered, mumbling the planetarium, Mount
Hollywood and Fern Dell in successive mouthfuls and swarmed
down to the concretelined bed of the Los Angeles River. Here
ineffectual shallow pools had preserved illusion and given tourists
something at which to laugh in the dry season; the weed
licked them up like a thirsty cow at a wallow. Up and down
and over the river it ran, each day with greater speed.</p>

<p>It broke into the watermains, it tore down the poles bearing
electric, telephone and telegraph wires, it forced its way between
the threaded joints of gaspipes and turned their lethal
vapor loose in the air until all services in the vicinity were
hastily discontinued. Short weeks after I'd inoculated Mrs
Dinkman's lawn, that part of Los Angeles known as Hollywood
had disappeared from the map of civilization and had
become one solid mass of green devilgrass.</p>

<p>No one refused to move for this dispossessor as they had for
the governor; thousands of homeless fled from it. Their going
clogged the highways with automobiles and produced an artificial
gasoline shortage reminiscent of wartime. In downtown<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
Los Angeles freightcars stood unloaded on their sidings, their
consignees out of business and the warehouses glutted. The
strain on local transportation, already enfeebled by a publicservice
system designed for a city one twentieth its size and a
complete lack of those facilities mandatory in every other large
center of population, increased by the necessary rerouting
around the affected area, threatened disruption of the entire
organism and the further disintegration of the city's already
weakened coordination. The values of realestate dropped,
houses were sold for a song, officebuildings for an aria, hotels
for a chorus.</p>

<p>The San Francisco Chamber of Commerce, secure in the
knowledge its city suffered from nothing worse than fires, earthquakes,
a miserable climate, and an invincible provincialism,
invited displaced businessmen to resettle themselves in an area
where improbable happenings were less likely; and the state
of Oklahoma organized a border patrol to keep out Californians.</p>

<p>I could not blame the realestate men for attempting to unload
their holdings before they suffered the fate of one tall
building at Hollywood and Highland. The grass closed about
its base like a false foundation and surged on to new conquests,
leaving the monolith bare and forlorn in its new surroundings.
At first the weed satisfied itself with jocular and teasing ventures
up the smooth sides; then, as though rasped by the skyscraper's
quiescence, it forced its way into the narrow space
between the steel sash, filling the lower floor and bursting out
again in a riot of whirling tendrils. Up the sides it climbed like
some false ivy; clinging, falling back, building upon its own
defeated body until it reached another story&mdash;and another and
another. At each one the tale was repeated: windows burglariously
forced, a floor suffocated, egress effected, and another
height of wall scaled. At the end the proud structure was a
lonely obelisk furred in a green covering to the very flagpole
on its peak, from which waved disappointed yet still aspiring
runners.</p>

<p>Upward and outward continuously, empty lot, fillingstation,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
artistic billboard, all alike to the greedy fingers. Like thumb
and index they formed a crescent, a threatening semicircle,
reaching forward by indirection. Northward and southeastward,
the two aqueducts kept the desert from reclaiming its
own; for fifty years the city had scraped up, bought, pilfered
or systematically robbed all the water it could get; through the
gray, wet lines, siphons, opencuts, pumps, lifts, tunnels, the
metropolis sucked life. Now the desert had an ally, the grassy
fingers avoided the downtown district, feeling purposefully
and dangerously toward the aqueducts.</p>

<p>I spent much of my time, when not actively watching the
grass, in the <i>Intelligencer</i> office. I had now agreed to write
articles for several weekly magazines, and though they edited
my copy with a heavy and unappreciative hand, still they never
outraged me as Le ffa&ccedil;as&eacute; did by causing another man to
usurp my name. Since I was in both senses nominally a member
of the staff, I had no qualms about using the journal's typewriters
and stationery for the construction of little essays on
the grass as seen through the eyes of one who had cause to know
it better than anyone else.</p>

<p>"The-uh curse of Garry-baldi be upon the head of that
ee-veal man who-uh controls this organeye-zation," rolled out
Gootes in pseudoChurchillian tones. "The-uh monster has
woven a web; we are-uh summoned, Bertie."</p>

<p>I got up resignedly and followed him to the managingeditor's
office. We were not greeted directly. Instead, a question
was thrown furiously over our heads. "Where is he? What
bristling and baseless egomania sways him to affront the <i>Daily
Intelligencer</i> with his contumacious and indecent unpunctuality?"</p>

<p>"Who, chief?" asked Gootes.</p>

<p>Le ffa&ccedil;as&eacute; ignored him. "When this great newspaper condescends
to shed the light of acceptance, to say nothing of an
obese and taxable paycheck, upon the gross corpus of an illiterate
moviecameraman, a false Daguerre, a spurious Steichen,
a dubious Eisenstein, it has a right to expect a return for the
goods showered upon such a deceitful sluggard."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>Still ignoring Gootes, he turned to me, and apparently putting
the berated one from his mind, went on with comparative
mildness: "Weener, an unparalleled experience is to fall to
your lot. You have not achieved this opportunity through any
excellence of your own, for I must say, after lengthy contact,
no vestige of merit in you is perceptible either to the nude eye
or through an ultramicroscope. Nevertheless, by pure unhappy
chance you are the property of the <i>Intelligencer</i>, and as such
this illustrious organ intends to confer upon you the signal
honor of being a Columbus, a Van Diemen, an Amundsen.
You, Weener, in your unworthy person, shall be the first man
to set foot upon a virgin land."</p>

<p>This speech being no more comprehensible to me than his
excoriation of an unknown individual, I could only stay silent
and try to look appreciative.</p>

<p>"Yes, Weener, you; some refugee from the busy newsroom
of the Zwingle (Iowa) <i>Weekly Patriot</i>," a disdainful handwave
referred this description to Gootes; "some miserable castoff
from a fourthrate quickie studio masquerading as a newscameraman;
and a party of sheep&mdash;perhaps I could simplify
my whole sentence by saying merely a party of bloody sheep&mdash;will
be landed by parachute on top of the grass this very afternoon."</p>

<p>He smacked his lips. "I can see tomorrow's bannerline now:
'Agent of Destruction Views Handiwork.' Should you chance
to survive, your ghostwritten impressions&mdash;for which we pay
too high a price, far too high a price&mdash;will become doubly valuable.
Should you come, as I confidently expect, to a logical
conclusion, the <i>Intelligencer</i> will supply a suitable obituary.
Now get the bloody hell out of here and either let me see you
never again, or as a triumphant Balboa who has sat, if not upon
a peak in Darien, at least upon something more important than
your own backside."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">23.</span> <span class="num2">T</span>he inside of the converted armybomber
smelled like exactly what it was&mdash;a barn. Ten sheep
and a solitary goat were tethered to stanchions along the sides.
The sheep bleated continuously, the goat looked cynically forbearing,
and all gave off an ammoniacal smell which was not
absorbed by the bed of hay under their hoofs.</p>

<p>Enthusiasm for this venture was an emotion I found practically
impossible to summon up. Even without Le ffa&ccedil;as&eacute;'s sanguinary
prophecies, I objected to the trip. I had never been in
a plane in my life, and this for no other reason than disinclination.
I feared every possible consequence of the parachutejump,
from instant annihilation through a broken neck in the
jerk of its opening, down to being smothered in its folds on
the ground. I distinctly did not want to go.</p>

<p>But caution sometimes defeats itself; I was so afraid of going
that I hesitated to admit my timidity and so I found myself
herded with my two companions, the pilot and crew, in with
the sheep and the goat. I was not resigned, but I was quiescent.
Gootes and the animals were not.</p>

<p>While we waited he went through his entire stock of tricks
including a few new ones which were not completely successful,
before the cameraman, panting, arrived ten minutes after
our scheduled departure. His name was Rafe Slafe&mdash;which I
thought an improbable combination of syllables&mdash;and he was
so chubby in every part you imagined you saw the smile which
ought to have gone with such a face and figure. Before his
breath had settled down to a normal routine, Gootes had
rushed upon him with an enthusiastic, "Ah, Rafello muchacho,
give to me the abrazo; como usted, compa&ntilde;ero?"</p>

<p>Slafe scorned reply, pushing Gootes aside with one plump
hand while with the other he tidied the sparse black hairs of
his mustache, which was trimmed down to an eyebrow shading
his lip. After inspecting and rejecting several identical bucketseats
he found one less to his distaste than the others and
stowed his equipment, which was extensive, requiring several
puffing trips backandforth, next to it. Then he lowered his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
backside onto the unyielding surface with the same anxiety
with which he might have deposited a fortune in a dubious
bank.</p>

<p>His hands darted in and out of pockets which apparently
held a small pharmacopoeia. Pulling out a roll of absorbentcotton
from which he plucked two wads, he stuck them
thoughtfully in his ears. He withdrew a nasalsyringe and used
it vigorously, swallowed gulps of a clearly labeled seasickremedy,
and then sucked at pills from various boxes whose
purpose was not so obvious. To conclude, he unstopped a glass
vial and sniffed at it. All the while Gootes hovered over him,
solicitously deluging him with friendly queries in one accent
or another.</p>

<p>I lost interest in both fellowpassengers, for the plane, after
shaking us violently, started forward, and before I was clearly
aware of it had left the ground. Looking from the windows I
regretted my first airplane ride hadnt been taken under less
trying circumstances, for it was an extraordinarily pleasant
experience to see the field dwindle into a miniature of itself
and the ground beneath become nothing more than a large
and highly colored reliefmap.</p>

<p>To our right was the stagnant river, dammed up behind the
blockading arm of grass. Leftward, downtown, the thumb of
the cityhall pointed rudely upward and far beyond was the
listless Pacific. Ahead, the gridiron of streets was shockingly
interrupted and severed by the great green mass plumped in its
center.</p>

<p>It grew to enormous bigness and everything else disappeared;
we were over and looked down upon it, a pasture
hummock magnified beyond belief; retaining its essential identity,
but made ominous by its unappropriate situation and size.
As we hovered above the very pinnacle, the rounded peak
which poked up at us, the pilot spoke over the intercommunication
system. "We will circle till the load is disposed of. First
the animals will be dropped, then the equipment, finally the
passengers. Is that clear?"</p>

<p>Everything was clear to me except how we should escape<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
from that green mountain once we had got upon it. This was
apparently in the hands of Le ffa&ccedil;as&eacute;, a realization, remembering
his grisly conversation, making me no easier in my mind.
Nor did I relish the pilot's casual description of myself as part
of a "load"&mdash;to be disposed of.</p>

<p>Slafe suddenly came to life and after peering through a sort
of lorgnette hanging round his neck, mumbling unintelligibly
to himself all the while, started his camera which went on
clicking magically with no apparent help from him. Efficiently
and swiftly the crew fastened upon the helpless and bleating
sheep their parachutes and onebyone dropped them through
the open bombbay. The goat went last and she did not bleat,
but dextrously butted two of her persecutors and micturated
upon the third before being cast into space.</p>

<p>I would have forgone the dubious honor of being the first to
land upon the grass, but the crew apparently had their orders;
I was courteously tapped upon the shoulder&mdash;I presume the
warders are polite when they enter the condemned cell at dawn&mdash;my
chute was strapped upon me and the instructions I had
already read in their printed form at least sixty times were
repeated verbally, so much to my confusion that when I was
finally in the air I do not know to this day whether I counted
six, sixty, six hundred, or six thousand before jerking the ripcord.
Whatever the number, it was evidently not too far
wrong, for although I received a marrowexploding shock, the
parachute opened and I floated down.</p>

<p>But no sooner were my fears of the parachute's performance
relieved than I was for the first time assailed with apprehension
at the thought of my destination. The grass, the weed, the
destroying body which had devoured so much was immediately
below me. I was irrevocably committed to come upon it&mdash;not
at its edges where other men battled with it heroically&mdash;but at
its very heart, where there were none to challenge it.</p>

<p>Still tormented and dejected, I landed easily and safely a few
feet from the goat and just behind the rearquarters of one of
the sheep.</p>

<p>And now I pause in my writing to sit quite still and remember&mdash;more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
than remember, live through again&mdash;the sensation
of that first physical contact with the heart of the grass. Ecstasy
is a pale word to apply to the joy of touching and resting upon
that verdure. Soft&mdash;yes, it was soft, but the way sand is soft,
unyieldingly. Unlike sand, however, it did not suggest a tightlypacked
foundation, but rather the firmness of a good mattress
resting on a wellmade spring. It was resilient, like carefully
tended turf, yet at the same time one thought, not of the solid
ground beneath, but of feathers, or even more of buoyant
clouds. My parachute having landed me gently on my feet, I
sank naturally to my knees, and then, impelled by some other
force than gravity, my body fell fully forward in complete
relaxation until my face was buried in the thickly growing
culms and my arms stretched out to embrace as much of the
lush surface as they could encompass.</p>

<p>Far more complex than the mere physical reactions were the
psychical ones. When a boy I had, like every other, daydreamed
of discovering new continents, of being first to climb a hitherto
unscaled peak, to walk before others the shores of strange
archipelagoes, to bring back tales of outlandish places and unfrequented
isles. Well, I was doing these things now, long after
the disillusionment adolescence brought to these childish
dreams. But in addition it was in a sense <i>my</i> island, <i>my</i> mountain,
<i>my</i> land&mdash;for I had caused it to be. A sensation of tremendous
vivacity and wellbeing seized upon me; I could not have
lain upon the grass more than half a second before I leaped to
my feet. With a nimbleness quite foreign to my natural habits
I detached the encumbering chute and jumped and danced
upon the sward. The goat regarded me speculatively through
rectangular pupils, but did not offer, in true capricious fashion,
to gambol with me. Her criticism did not stay me, for I
felt absolutely free, extraordinarily exhilarated, inordinately
stimulated. I believe I even went so far as to shout out loud
and break into song.</p>

<p>The descent of Slafe, still solemnly recording the event,
camera before him in the position of present arms, did not
sober my intoxication, though circumspection caused me to act<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
in a more conventional way. I freed him from his harness, for
he was too busy taking views of the grass, the sky, the animals
and me to perform this service for himself.</p>

<p>I do not know if he was affected the way I was, for his deceptively
genial face showed no emotion as he went on aiming his
camera here and there with sour thoroughness. Then, apparently
satisfied for the moment, he applied himself once more
to the nasalsyringe and the pillboxes.</p>

<p>On Gootes, however, the consequence of the landing must
have been much the same as on me. He too capered and sang
and his dialect renderings reached a new low, such as even a
burlesqueshow comedian would have spurned. "Tis the old
sod itself," he kept repeating, "Erin go bragh. Up Dev!" and
he laughed inanely.</p>

<p>We must have wasted fully an hour in this fashion before
enough coolness returned to allow anything like calm observation.
When it did, we unpacked the equipment, despite obstacles
interposed by Gootes, who, still hilarious, found great
delight in making the various instruments disappear and reappear
unexpectedly. It was quite complete and we&mdash;or rather
Slafe&mdash;recorded the thermometer and barometer readings as
well as the wind direction and altitude, these to be later compared
with others taken under normal conditions at the same
hour.</p>

<p>Included in the gear were telescope and binoculars; these
we put to our eyes only to realize with surprise that we were
located in the center of a hollow bowl perhaps a hundred and
fifty or two hundred feet across and that an horizon of upsurging
vegetation cut off our view of anything except the sky itself.
I could have sworn we had landed on a flat plateau, if
indeed the contour had not sloped upward to a cap. How,
then, did we come to find ourselves in a depression? Did the
grass shift like the sea it resembled? Or&mdash;incredible thought&mdash;had
our weight caused us to sink imperceptibly into a soft and
treacherous bed?</p>

<p>I felt my happiness oozing away. What is man, I thought, but
a pigmy trapped in a bowl, bounded by an unknown beginning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
and headed for a concealed destination? It was sweet to
be, but whether good or evil lay in the unseen, who knew?
Uneasiness, which did not quite displace my earlier buoyancy,
took hold of me.</p>

<p>The animals, in contrast, gave no signals of disquiet. They
cropped at the grass without nervousness, perhaps more from
habit than hunger. They did not seem to be obtaining much
sustenance; clearly they found it hard to bite off mouthfuls of
forage. Rather, they chewed sidewise, like a cat, at the tough
rubbery tendrils.</p>

<p>"I tank I want to go home&mdash;anyways I tank I want to get out
of dis haole," remarked Gootes. Slafe had unpacked another
camera and attached various gadgets to it, pursing his lips and
running his hands lovingly over the assembled product before
thrusting it downward into the stolons where queer shocks of
radiance seemed to indicate he was taking flashlight pictures of
the subsurface.</p>

<p>But the sheep and the cameraman could not distract my
attention from the appearance of a trap which the basin of
grass was assuming, while Gootes was so volatile he couldnt
even put on a simulated stoicism. In a panic I started to climb
frantically, all the elation of my first encounter with the
mound completely evaporated. The goat raised her head to
note my undignified scrambling, but the sheep kept up their
determined nibbling.</p>

<p>The trough, as I said, could not have been more than a
couple of hundred feet across and though the loose runners
impeded my progress I must have covered twice the distance
to the edge of the rim before I realized it was as far from me as
when I had started. Gootes, going in a direction oblique to
mine, had no better success. His waving arms and struggling
body indicated his awareness of his predicament. Only Slafe
was undisturbed, perhaps unconscious of our efforts, for he
had taken out still another camera and was lying on his back,
pointing it over our heads at the boundary of grass and sky.</p>

<p>Hysteria burned my lungs as I continued the dreamlike
battle upward. Fear may have confused me, but it seemed as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
though the enveloping weed was now positively rather than
merely negatively hampering me. The runners whipped
around my legs in clinging spirals; the surface, always soft,
now developed treacherous spots like quicksands and while
one foot remained comparatively secure, the other sank deeply,
tripping me. Prone, the entangling fronds caught at my arms
and neck; the green blades, no longer tender, scratched my
face and smothered my useless cries for help. I sobbed childishly,
knowing myself doomed to die in this awful morass,
drowned in an unnatural sea.</p>

<p>So despairing were my thoughts that I gave up all struggle
and lay there weakly crying when I noticed the grass relaxing
its hold, I was sinking in no farther; indeed it seemed the lightest
effort would set me free. I rose to my knees and finally to
my feet, but I was so shaken by my battle I made no attempt to
continue forward, but stood gazing around me marveling that
I was still, even if only for a few more moments, alive.</p>

<p>"Belly belong you walk about too much, ay? Him fella look-look
no got belly." Gootes had given up his endeavor to reach
the rim and apparently struggled all the way over to impart, if
I understood his <i>b&ecirc;chedemer</i>, this absurd and selfevident piece
of information.</p>

<p>"This is hardly a time for levity," I rebuked him coldly.</p>

<p>"Couldnt think of a better. Reality is escaped through one
flippancy or another. Rafe has his&mdash;" he waved his hand toward
the still industrious cameraman "&mdash;and I have mine. I bet
W R has a telescope or a periscope or a spectroscope somehow
trained on us right now and will see to it the rescue party
arrives ten minutes after all life is extinct."</p>

<p>To tell the truth I'd forgotten our expedition was but a stunt
initiated by the <i>Daily Intelligencer</i> to rebound to its greater
publicity. Here in this isolate cup it was difficult to conceive of
an anterior existence; I thought of myself, as in some strange
manner indigenous to and part of the weed. To recall now that
we were here purposefully, that others were concerned with
our venture, and that we might reasonably hope for succor
extricated me from my subjective entanglement with the grass<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
much as the relaxation of my body a short while before freed
me from its physical bonds. I looked hopefully at the empty
sky: of course we would get help at any moment.</p>

<p>Once more my spirits were raised; there was no point in trying
to get out of the depression now, seeing we could as easily
be rescued from one portion of the grass as from another.
Again the grass was soft and pleasant to touch and Slafe's preoccupation
with his pictures no longer seemed either eccentric
or heroic, but rather proper and sensible. Like Alice and the
Red Queen, since we had given up trying to reach a particular
spot we found ourselves able to travel with comparative ease.
We inspected Slafe's activities with interest and responded
readily to his autocratic gestures indicating positions and poses
we should take in order to be incorporated in his record.</p>

<p>But our gaiety was again succeeded by another period of
despondency; we repeated all our antics, struggles and despair.
Again I fought madly against the enmeshing weed and again I
gave myself up to death only to be revived in the moment of
my resignation.</p>

<p>The cameraman was still untouched by the successive waves
of fear and joyfulness. Invincibly armored by some strange
spirit he kept on and on, although by now I could not understand&mdash;in
those moments when I could think about anything
other than the grass&mdash;what new material he could find for his
film. Skyward and downward, to all points of the compass,
holding his cameras at crazy angles, burlesquing all photographers,
his zeal was unabated, unaffected even by the force of
the grass.</p>

<p>Our alternating moods underwent a subtle change: the
spans of defeat grew longer, the moments of hope more fleeting.
The sheep too at last were infected by uneasiness, bleating
piteously skyward and making no attempt to nibble any longer.
The goat, like Slafe, was unmoved; she disdained the emotional
sheep.</p>

<p>And now with horror I suddenly realized that a physical
change had marched alongside the fluctuations of our temper.
The circumference of the bowl was the same as at first, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
imperceptibly yet swiftly the hollow had deepened, sunk farther
from the sky, the walls had become almost perpendicular
and to my terror I found myself looking upward from the
bottom of a pit at the retreating sky.</p>

<p>I suppose everyone at some time has imagined himself irrevocably
imprisoned, cast into some lightless dungeon and left
to die. Such visions implied human instrumentality, human
whim; the most implacable jailer might relent. But this, this
was an incarceration no supplication could end, a doom not to
be stayed. Silently, evenly, unmeasuredly the well deepened
and the walls became more sheer.</p>

<p>Like kittens about to be ignominiously drowned we slid into
a huddled bunch at the bottom of the sack, men and animals
equally helpless and distraught. Fortunately it was during one
of the now rare periods of resurgence that we saw the helicopter,
for I do not think we should have had the spiritual strength
needful to help ourselves had it come during our times of
dejection. Gootes and I yelled and waved our arms frenziedly,
while Slafe, exhibiting faint excitement for the first time, contorted
himself to aim the camera at the machine's belly. Evidently
the pilot spotted us without difficulty for the ship came
to a hovering rest over the mouth of the well and a jacobsladder
unrolled its length to dangle rope sides and wooden rungs
down to us.</p>

<p>"Snatched from the buzzsaw as the express thundered across
the switch and the water came up to our noses," chanted
Gootes. "W R has a vilely melodramatic sense of timing."</p>

<p>The ladder was nearest Slafe, but working more furiously
than ever, he waved it impatiently aside and so I grasped it
and started upward. The terror of the ascent paradoxically was
a welcome one, for it was the common fear which comes to men
on the battlefield or in the creaking hours of the night, the
natural dread of ordinary perils and not the unmanning panic
inspired by the awful unknown within the grass.</p>

<p>The helicopter shuddered and dipped, causing the unanchored
ladder to sway and twist until with each convulsive jerk
I expected to be thrown off. I bruised and burned my palms<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
with the tightness of my grip, my knees twitched and my face
and back and chest were wet. But in spite of all this, waves of
thankfulness surged over me.</p>

<p>The roaring and rattling above grew louder and I made my
way finally into the open glassfronted cockpit, pulling myself
in with the last bit of my strength. For a long moment I lay
huddled there, exhausted. My eye took in every trifle, every
bolthead, rivet, scratch, dent, indicator, seam and panel, playing
with them in my mind, making and rejecting patterns.
They were artificial, made on a blessed assemblyline&mdash;no terrifying
product of nature.</p>

<p>I wondered how so small a space could accommodate us all
and was devoutly grateful that I, at least, had achieved safety.
Reminded of my companions, I looked out and down. The
grass walls towered upward almost within reach; beyond the
hole they so unexpectedly made in its surface the weed
stretched out levelly, peaceful and inviting. I shuddered and
peered down the reversed telescope where the ladder once
more hung temptingly before Slafe.</p>

<p>Again he waved it aside. Gootes appeared to argue with him
for he shook his head obstinately and went on using his camera.
At length the reporter seized him forcibly with a strength
I had not known he possessed and boosted him up the first
rungs of the ladder. Slafe seemed at last resigned to leave, but
he pointed anxiously to his other cameras and cans of film.
Gootes nodded energetically and waved the photographer
upward.</p>

<p>I saw every detail of what happened then, emphasized and
heightened as though revealed through a slowmotion picture.
I heard Slafe climb on board and knew that in a few seconds
now we would be free and away. I saw the bright sun reflect itself
dazzlingly upon the blades of the grass, sloping imperceptibly
away to merge with the city it squatted upon in the
distance.</p>

<p>The sun where we were was dazzling, I say, but in the hole
where Gootes was now tying Slafe's paraphernalia to the ladder,
the shadow of the walls darkened it into twilight. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
squinted, telepathically urging him to hurry; he seemed slow
and fumbling. And then ...</p>

<p>And then the walls collapsed. Not slowly, not with warning,
not dramatically or with trumpets. They came together as
silently and naturally as two waves close a trough in the ocean,
but without disturbance or upheaval. They fell into an embrace,
into a coalescence as inevitable as the well they obliterated
was fortuitous. They closed like the jaws of a trap
somehow above malevolence, leaving only the top of the ladder
projecting upward from the smooth and placid surface of the
weed.</p>

<p>Whether in some involuntary recoil the pilot pressed a
wrong control or whether the action of the grass itself snatched
the ladder from the ship I don't know; but that last bit attached
to the machine was torn free and fell upon the green. It
was the only thing to mark the spot where the bowl which had
held us had been, and it lay, a brown and futile tangle of rope
and wood, a helpless speck of artifice on an imperturbable
mass of vegetation.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">24.</span> <span class="num2">M</span>r Le ffa&ccedil;as&eacute; removed the tube of
the dictaphone from his lips as I entered. "Weener, although
a rigid adherence to fact compels me to claim some acquaintance
with general knowledge and a slight cognizance of abnormal
psychology, I must admit bafflement at the spectacle of
your mottled complexion once more in these rooms sacred to
the perpetuation of truth and the dissemination of enlightenment.
Everyday you embezzle good money from this paper
under pretense of giving value received, and each day your
uselessness becomes more conspicuous. Almost anyone would
disapprove the divine choice in the matter of taking Gootes
and leaving you alive, and while I know the world suffered not
the least hurt by his translation to whatever baroque, noisy
and entirely public hell is reserved for reporters, at least he
attempted to forge some ostensible return for his paycheck."</p>

<p>"Mr Le ffa&ccedil;as&eacute;," I began indignantly, but he cut me off.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>"You unalloyed imbecile," he roared, "at least have the
prudence if not the intelligence or courtesy to be silent while
your betters are speaking. Gootes was a bloody knave, a lazy,
slipshod, slack, tasteless, absurd, fawning, thieving, conniving
sloven, but even if he had the energy to make the attempt and
a mind to put to it, he could not, in ten lifetimes, become the
perfect, immaculate and prototypical idiot you were born."</p>

<p>I don't know how long he would have continued in this
insulting vein, but he was interrupted by the concealed telephone.
"What in the name of the ten thousand dubious virgins
do you mean by annoying me?" he bellowed into the
mouthpiece. "Yes. Yes. I know all about deadlines; I was a
newspaperman when you were vainly suckling canine dugs.
Are you ambitious to replace me? Go get with child a mandrakeroot,
you, you journalist! I will meet the <i>Intelligencer</i>'s
deadline as I did before your father got the first tepidly lustful
idea in his nulliparous head and as I shall after you have followed
your useless testes to a worthy desuetude."</p>

<p>He replaced the receiver and picked up the mouthpiece of
the dictaphone again, paying no further attention to me. He
enunciated clearly and precisely, speaking in an even monotone,
pausing not at all, as if reading from some prepared
script, though his eyes were fixed upon a vacant spot where
wall and ceiling joined.</p>

<p>"In the death today of Jacson Gootes the <i>Daily Intelligencer</i>
lost a son. It is an old and good custom on these solemn occasions
to pause and remember the dead.</p>

<p>"Jacson Gootes was a reporter of exceptional probity, of
clear understanding, of indefatigable effort, and of great native
ability. His serious and straightforward approach to an
occupation which to him was a labor of love was balanced by a
sunny yet thoughtful humor, a combination making his company
something to be sought. Beloved of his fellow workers,
no one mourns his loss more sincerely than the editor through
whose hands passed all those brilliant contributions, now
finally marked, as all newspaper copy is, -30-.</p>

<p>"But though the <i>Intelligencer</i> has suffered a personal and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
deeply felt bereavement, American journalism has given another
warrior on the battlefield. Not by compulsion nor arbitrary
selection, but of his own free will, he who serves the
public through the press is a soldier. And as a soldier he is
ready at the proper time to go forward and give up his life if
need be.</p>

<p>"No member of a sturdy army was more worthy of a gallant
end than Jacson Gootes. He died, not in some burst of audacity
such as may occasionally actuate men to astonishing feats, but
doggedly and calmly in the line of duty. More than a mere
hero, he was a good newspaperman. W.R.L."</p>

<p>There were tears under my eyelids as the editor concluded
his eulogy. Under that gruff and even overbearing exterior
must beat a warm and tender heart. You can't go by appearances,
I always say, and I felt I would never again be hurt by
whatever hasty words he chose to hurl at me.</p>

<p>"Wake up, you moonstruck simpleton, and stop beaming at
some private vision. The time has passed for you to live on the
bounty of the <i>Intelligencer</i> like the bloody mendicant you
are. You have outlived your usefulness as the man who started
all this fuss; it is no longer good publicity; the matter has
become too serious.</p>

<p>"No, Weener, from now on, beneath your unearned byline
the public will know you only as the first to set foot upon this
terra incognita, this verdant isle which flourishes senselessly
where only yesterday Hollywood nourished senselessly. So rest
no more upon your accidental laurels, but transform yourself
into what nature never intended, a useful member of the community.
I will make a newspaperman of you, Weener, if I have
to beat into your head an entire typefont, from fourpoint up
to and including those rare boldfaced letters we keep in the
cellar to announce on our final page one the end of the world.</p>

<p>"You will cover the grass as before and you will bring or
send or cause in some other manner to be transmitted to me
copy without a single adjective or adverb, containing nothing
more lethal than verbs, nouns, prepositions and conjunctions,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
stating facts and only facts, clearly and distinctly in the least
possible number of words compatible with the usages of English
grammar. You will do this daily and conscientiously,
Weener, on pain of instant dismemberment, to say nothing of
crucifixion and the death of a thousand cuts."</p>

<p>"The <i>Weekly Ruminant</i> and the <i>Honeycomb</i> have found
little pieces of mine, written without special instructions, suitable
for their columns," I mentioned defensively.</p>

<p>He threw himself back in his chair and stared at me with
such concentrated fury I thought he would burst the diamond
stud loose from his shirtband. "The <i>Weekly Ruminant</i>," he
informed me, "was founded by a parsimonious whoremaster
whose sanctimonious rantings in public were equaled only by
his private impieties. It was brought to greatness&mdash;if inflated
circulation be a synonym&mdash;by a veritable journalistic pimp
who pandered to the public taste for literary virgins by bribing
them to commit their perverse acts in full view. It is now
carried on by a spectral corporation, losing circulation at the
same rate a haemophilic loses blood.</p>

<p>"As for the <i>Honeycomb</i>, it is enough to say that careful
research proves its most absorbing reading to be the 'throw
away your truss' ads. Is it not natural, Weener, that two such
journals of taste and enlightenment should appreciate your
efforts? Unfortunately the <i>Daily Intelligencer</i> demands accounts
written in intelligible English above the level of fourthgrade
grammarschool."</p>

<p>I would have been shocked beyond measure at his libelous
smirching of honored names and hurt as well by his slighting
reference to myself had I not known from the revealing editorial
he had dictated what a sympathetic and kindly nature
was really his and how he might, beneath this cynical pose,
have an admiration great as mine for the characters he had
just slandered.</p>

<p>"You will be the new Peter Schlemihl, Weener; from now
on you will go forth without a ghost and any revision essential
to your puny assault upon the Republic of Letters will be done
by me and God help you if I find much to do, for my life is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
passing and I must have time to read the immortal Hobbes
before I die."</p>

<p>In spite of all he'd said I couldnt help but believe Mr
Le ffa&ccedil;as&eacute; realized my true worth&mdash;or why did he confer on
me what was practically a promotion? I was therefore emboldened
to suggest the cancellation of the unjust paycut, but this
innocent remark called forth such a vituperative stream of
epithet I really thought the apoplexy Gootes had predicted
was about to strike and I hurried from his presence lest I be
blamed for bringing it on.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">25.</span> <span class="num2">A</span> little reading brought me uptodate
on the state of the grass as a necessary background for my
new responsibility. It was now shaped like a great, irregular
crescent with one tip at Newhall, broadening out to bury the
San Fernando Road; stretching over the Santa Monica Mountains
from Beverly Glen to the Los Angeles River. Its fattest
part was what had once been Hollywood, Beverly Hills and
the socalled Wilshire district. The right arm of the semicircle,
more slender than the left, curled crookedly eastward along
Venice Boulevard, in places only a few blocks wide. It severed
the downtown district from the manufacturing area, crossing
the river near the Ninth Street bridge and swallowing the
great Searsroebuck store like a capsule. The office of the <i>Daily
Intelligencer</i>, like the Civic Center, was unthreatened and
able to function, but we were without water and gas, though
the electric service, subject to annoying interruptions, was still
available.</p>

<p>Already arrangements were being completed to move the
paper to Pomona, where the mayor and councilmanic offices
also intended to continue. For there was no hiding the fact
that the city was being surrendered to the weed. Eastward and
southward the homeless and the alarmed journeyed carrying
the tale of a city besieged and gutted in little more than the
time it would have taken a human army to fight the necessary
preliminaries and bring up its big guns.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>On trains and buses, by bicycles and on foot, the exodus
moved. Those who could afford it left their ravished homes
swiftly behind by air and to these fortunate ones the way
north was not closed, as it was to the earthbound, by the weed's
overrunning of the highways. Usedcardealers sold out their
stocks at inflated figures and a ceilingprice had to be put on
the gasoline supplied to those retreating from the grass.</p>

<p>Though only a fragment of the city had been lost, all industry
had come to a practical standstill. Workers did not care to
leave homes which might be grassbound by nightfall; employers
could not manufacture without backlog of materials, for a
dwindling market, and without transportation for their products.
Services were so crippled as to be barely existent and with
the failure of the watersupply, epidemics, mild at first, broke
out and the diseases were carried and spread by the refugees.</p>

<p>Cattlemen, uncertain there would be either stockyards or
working butchers, held back their shipments. Truckfarmers
found it simpler and more profitable to supply local depots
catering at fantastic prices to the needs of the fugitives, than
to depend on railroads which were already overstrained and
might consign their highly perishable goods to rot on a siding.
Los Angeles began to starve. Housewives rushed frantically
to clean out the grocer's shelves, but this was living off their
own fat and even the most farsighted of hoarders could provide
for no more than a few weeks of future.</p>

<p>So even those not directly evicted or frightened by its proximity
began moving away from the grass. But they still had
possessions and they wanted to take them along, all of them,
down to the obsolescent console radio in grandma's room, the
busted mantelclock&mdash;a weddingpresent from Aunt Minnie&mdash;in
the garage and the bridgelamp without a shade which had
so long rested in the mopcloset. All of this taxed an already
overstrained transportation system. Since it was entirely a oneway
traffic, charges were naturally doubled and even then
shippers were reluctant to risk the return of their equipment
to the threatened zone. The greed to take along every last bit
of impedimenta dwindled under the impact of necessity; possessions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
were scrutinized for what would be least missed, then
for what could be got along without; for the absolutely essential,
and finally for things so dear it was not worth going if
they were left behind. This last category proved surprisingly
small, compact enough to be squeezed into the family car&mdash;"Junior
can sit on the box of fishingtackle&mdash;it's flat&mdash;and hold
the birdcage on his lap"&mdash;as it made ready to join the procession
crawling along the clogged highways.</p>

<p><i>Time</i>, reporting the progress of the weed, said in part:
"Death, as it must to all, came last week to cult-harboring,
movie-producing Los Angeles. The metropolis of the southwest
(pop. 3,012,910) died gracelessly, undignifiedly, as its
blood oozed slowly away. A shell remained: downtown district,
suburbs, beaches, sprawling South and East sides, but
the spirit, heart, brain, lungs and liver were gone; swallowed
up, Jonah-wise by the advance of the terrifying Bermuda
grass (TIME Aug. 10). Still at his post was sunk-eyed W. (for
William) R. (for Rufus) Le ffa&ccedil;as&eacute; (pronounced L'Fass-uh-say),
prolix, wide-read editor of the Los Angeles <i>Intelligencer</i>.
Till the last press stopped the <i>Intelligencer</i> would continue
to disseminate the news. Among those remaining was Le
ffa&ccedil;as&eacute;'s acereporter, Jacson C. (for Crayman) Gootes, 28.
Gootes' permanent beat: the heart of the menacing grass
where he met his death."</p>

<p>Under Religion, <i>Time</i> had another note about the weed.
"Harassed Angelinos, distracted &amp; terrified by encroaching
<i>Cynodon dactylon</i> (TIME Aug. 10) now smothering their
city (see National Affairs) were further distracted when turning
on their radios (those still working) last week. The nasal,
portentous boom of the evangelist calling himself Brother
Paul (real name: Algernon Knight Mood) announced the
2nd Advent. It was taking place in the heart of the choking
grass. What brought death and disaster to the country's 3rd
city offered hope and bliss to followers of Brother Paul. 'Sell
all you have,' advised the radiopreacher, 'fly to your Savior who
is gathering His true disciples at this moment in the very
center of the grass. Do not fear, for He will sustain and comfort<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
you in the thicket through which the unsaved cannot
pass.' At last report countless followers had been forcibly restrained
from self-immolation in the <i>Cynodon dactylon</i>, unnumbered
others gone joyfully to their beatification. Not yet
reported as joining his Savior: Brother Paul."</p>

<p>Under People: "Admitted to the Relief rolls of San Diego
County this week were Adam Dinkman &amp; wife, whose front
lawn (TIME Aug. 3) was the starting point of the plaguing
grass. Said Mrs. Dinkman, 'The government ought to
pay....' Said Adam Dinkman, '... it's a terrible
thing....'"</p>

<p>I resolved to send the Dinkmans some money as soon as I
could possibly afford it. I made a note to this effect in a pocket
memorandumbook, feeling the glow of worthy sacrifice, and
then went out and got in my car. It was all right to digest facts
and figures about the weed from the printed page, but it was
necessary to see again its physical presence before writing anything
for so critical an editor as W R Le ffa&ccedil;as&eacute;.</p>

<p>I drove through the Second Street tunnel and out Beverly
Boulevard. There, several miles from the most advanced runners
of the grass, the certainty of its coming lay like a smothering
blanket upon the unnaturally silent district. There was
no traffic on my side of the street and only a few lastminute
straggling jalopies, loaded down with shameless bedding and
bundles, coughed their way frantically eastward.</p>

<p>Those few shops still unaccountably open were bare of
goods and the idle proprietors walked periodically to the
front to scan the western sky to assure themselves the grass
was not yet in sight. But most of the stores were closed, their
windows broken, their signs already tarnished and decrepit
with the age which seems to come so swiftly upon a defunct
business. The sidewalks were littered with rubbish, diagonally
flattened papers, broken boxes, odd shoes. Garbagecans, instead
of standing decorously in alleys or shamefacedly along
the curb, sprawled in lascivious abandon over the pavements,
their contents strewn widely. Dogs and cats, deserted by fond
owners, snarled and fought over choicer tidbits. I had not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
realized how many people in the city kept pets until the time
came to leave them behind.</p>

<p>At Vermont Avenue I came upon what I was sure was a new
nucleus, a lawn green and tall set between others withered
and yellow, but I did not even bother reporting this to the
police for I knew that before long the main body would take
it to its bosom. And now, looking westward, I could see the
grass itself, a half mile away at Normandie. It rose high in the
air, dwarfing the buildings in its path, blotting out the mountains
behind, and giving the illusion of rushing straight at me.</p>

<p>I turned the car north, not with the idea of further observation,
but because standing still in the face of that towering
palisade seemed somehow to invite immediate destruction.
I drove slowly and thoughtfully and then at Melrose the grass
came in sight again, creeping down from Los Feliz. I turned
back toward the Civic Center. It would not be more than a
couple of days at most, now, before even downtown was gone.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">26.</span> <span class="num2">D</span>uring my drive several walkers
loaded with awkward bundles raised imploring thumbs for a
ride, but knowing to what lengths desperation will drive
people and not wishing to be robbed of my car, I had pressed
my foot down and driven on. But now as I went along Temple
near Rampart a beautiful woman, incongruously&mdash;for it was
in the middle of a hot October&mdash;dressed in a fur coat, and with
each gloved hand grasping the handle of a suitcase, stepped
in front of me and I had to jam on the brakes to avoid running
over her.</p>

<p>The car stopped, radiator almost touching her, but she
made no attempt to move. A small hat with a tiny fringe of
veil concealed her eyes, but her sullen mouth looked furiously
at me as rigidly clutching her luggage she barred my path.
Fearing some trap, I turned off the ignition and unobtrusively
slid the keys into a sidepocket before getting out and going
to her.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, miss. Can I help you?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>She threw her head back and her eyes, brown and glistening,
appraised me through heavily painted lashes. I stood there
stiffly, uncomfortable under her gaze till I suddenly remembered
my hat and lifted it with an awkward bow. This seemed
to satisfy her, for still without speaking she nodded and thrust
the two suitcases at me. Not knowing what else to do, I took
them from her and she promptly, after smoothing her gloves,
walked toward the passenger's side of the car.</p>

<p>"You want me to take you somewhere, miss?" I inquired
quite superfluously.</p>

<p>She bent her head the merest fraction and then rested her
fingers on the doorhandle, waiting for me to open it for her.
I ran as fast as I could with the bags&mdash;they were beautifully
matched expensive luggage&mdash;to put them in the turtle and
then had to make myself still more ridiculous by running
back for the forgotten key resting in the sidepocket. When I
had finally stowed away the baggage and opened the door for
her she got in with the barest of condescending nods for my
efforts and sat staring ahead.</p>

<p>I drove very slowly, nipping off little glances of her profile
as we moved along. Her cheeks were smooth as a chinadoll's,
her nose the chiseled replica of some lovely antique marble,
her mouth a living study of rounded lines; never had I been
so close to such an alluring woman. We reached the Civic
Center and I automatically headed for the <i>Intelligencer</i> building.
But I could not bear to part company so quickly and so I
turned left instead, out Macy Street.</p>

<p>Now we found ourselves caught in the traffic snailing eastward.
In low gear I drove a block, then stopped and waited
till a clear ten feet ahead permitted another painfully slow
forward motion. Still my passenger had no word to say but
kept staring ahead though she could see nothing before her
except the trunkladen rearend of a tottery ford long past its
majority.</p>

<p>"You," I stumbled, "I&mdash;that is, I mean wasnt there somewhere
in particular you wanted to go?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>She nodded, still without looking at me, and for the first
time spoke.</p>

<p>Her voice was deep and had the timbre of some old bronze
bell. "Yuma," she said.</p>

<p>"Yuma, Arizona?" I asked stupidly.</p>

<p>Again she nodded faintly. In a panic I reckoned the contents
of my wallet. About forty dollars, I thought&mdash;no, thirty.
Would that take us to Yuma? Barely, perhaps, and I should
have to wire the <i>Intelligencer</i> for money to return. Besides, in
the present condition of the roads the journey would be a
matter of days and I knew she would accept nothing but the
very best. How could I do it? Should I return to the <i>Intelligencer</i>
office and try to get an advance on next week's salary?
I had heard from more than one disgruntled reporter that it
was an impossibility. Good heavens, I thought, I shall lose her.</p>

<p>Whatever happened I must take her as far as I could; I must
not let her go before I was absolutely forced to. This resolution
made, my first thought was to cut the time, for poking
along in this packed mass I was burning gasoline without
getting anywhere. Taking advantage of my knowledge of the
sideroads, I turned off at the first chance and was able to resume
a normal speed as I avoided towns and main highways.</p>

<p>Still she continued silent, until at length, passing orangegroves
heavy with coppery fruit, I ventured to speak myself.
"My name is Albert Weener. Bert."</p>

<p>The right rear tire kicked up some dust as I nervously edged
off the road. Somewhere overhead a plane ripped through the
hot silk of the sky.</p>

<p>"Uh ... what ... uh ... won't you tell me yours?"</p>

<p>Still facing ahead, she replied, "It isnt necessary."</p>

<p>After a few more miles I ventured again. "You live&mdash;were
living in Los Angeles?"</p>

<p>She shook her head impatiently.</p>

<p>Well, I thought, really...! Then: poor thing, she's probably
terribly upset. Home and family lost perhaps. Money
gone. Destitute. Going East, swallowing pride, make a new
start with the help of unsympathetic relatives. She has only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
me to depend on&mdash;I must not fail her. Break the ice, whatever
attitude her natural pride dictates, offer your services.</p>

<p>"I'm on the <i>Daily Intelligencer</i>," I said. "I'm the man who
first walked on top of the grass."</p>

<p>Ten miles later I inquired, "Wouldnt you be more comfortable
with that heavy fur coat off? I can put it in the back with
your luggage and it won't be crushed."</p>

<p>She shook her head more impatiently.</p>

<p>Suddenly I remembered the car radio installed a few days
before. A little cheerful music calms the soul. I turned it on
and got a band playing a brandnew hit, "Green as Grass."</p>

<p>"Oh, no. No noise."</p>

<p>Of course. How thoughtless of me. The very word "grass"
reminded her of her tragic situation. I kicked myself for my
tactlessness.</p>

<p>We skirted Riverside and joined the highway again at
Beaumont where we were unavoidably packed into the slowmoving
mass. "I'm sorry," I apologized, "but I can take a
chance again at Banning and drive up into the mountains to
get away from this."</p>

<p>An hour later I suggested stopping for something to eat.
She shook her head. "But it's getting late," I said. "Pretty soon
we shall have to think about stopping for the night."</p>

<p>She raised her left hand imperatively. "Drive all night."</p>

<p>This would certainly solve part of my financial problem,
but I was hungry and unreasonably more irritated by her
refusal of food than her unsociability. "I have to eat, even if
you don't," I told her rudely. "I'm going to stop at the next
place I see." With the same left hand she made a gesture of
resignation.</p>

<p>I pulled up before the roadside cafe. "Won't you change
your mind and come in? At least for a cup of coffee?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>I went in angrily and ate. Who was she, to treat me like a
hired chauffeur? A mere pickup, I raged, a stray woman found
on a street. By God, she would have the courtesy at least to
address me, her benefactor, civilly or else I'd abandon her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
here on the highway and return to Los Angeles. I finished my
meal full of determination and strode back purposefully toward
the car. She was still sitting rigid, staring through the
windshield. I got in.</p>

<p>"You know&mdash;" I began.</p>

<p>She did not hear me. I turned on the ignition, pressed the
starterbutton, and drove ahead.</p>

<p>Soddeneyed with lack of sleep and outraged at her taciturnity,
I breakfasted alone on the soggiest wheatcakes and
the muddiest coffee I have ever demeaned my stomach with.
The absence of my customary morning paper added the final
touch to my wretchedness. But one would have thought to
look at my companion that she had been refreshed by a
lengthy repose, had bathed at leisure, and eaten the most delicate
of continental breakfasts. There was not a smudge on her
suede gloves nor a speck upon her small hat and the mascara
on her eyelashes might have been renewed but a moment
before.</p>

<p>The road curved through vast hummocks of sand, which
for no good reason reminded me of the grass in its early stages.
Reminded, I wanted to know what the latest news was, how
far the weed had progressed in the night. Thoughtlessly, without
remembering her interdiction, I turned the knob. "Kfkfkk,"
squeaked the radio.</p>

<p>"Please," she said, in anything but a pleading tone, and
turned it off.</p>

<p>Well, I thought, this is certainly going too far. I opened my
mouth to voice the angry words but a look at her stopped me.
I couldnt help but feel her imperviousness was fragile, that
harsh speech might shatter a calm too taut to be anything but
hysterical. I drove on without speaking until the hummocks
gave way again to smooth desert. "We'll soon be in Yuma," I
announced. "Arent you going to tell me your name?"</p>

<p>"It isnt important," she repeated.</p>

<p>"But it's important to me," I told her boldly. "I want to
know who the beautiful lady was whom I drove from Los
Angeles to Yuma."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>She shook her head irritably and we crossed the bridge into
Arizona.</p>

<p>"All right, this is Yuma. Now where?"</p>

<p>"Here."</p>

<p>"Right here in the middle of the road?"</p>

<p>She nodded. I looked helplessly at her, but her gaze was
still fixed ahead. Resignedly I got out, took her bags from
the turtle and set them beside the road, opened the door. She
descended, smoothed her gloves, straightened the edge of her
veil, brushed an immaterial speck from her coat and, after
the briefest of acknowledging nods, picked up her grips.</p>

<p>"But ... can't I carry them for you?"</p>

<p>She did not even answer this with her usual headshake, but
began walking resolutely back over the way we had come. Bewildered,
I watched her a moment and then got into the car
and turned it around, trying to keep her in sight in the rearview
mirror as I did so. It was an awkward procedure on a
highway heavy with traffic. By the time I had reversed my direction
she was gone.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">27.</span> <span class="num2">D</span>ue either to Le ffa&ccedil;as&eacute;'s perverse
sense of humor or, what is more likely, his excessive meanness
with money, my collect telegram asking for funds to return
from Yuma received the following ridiculous reply: KNOW
NO SANGUINARY WEENER INTELLIGENCER NO
ELEEMOSYNARY INSTITUTION EAT CAKE. The
meaning of the last two words escaped me and it was possible
they were added purely to make the requisite ten. At all events
Le ffa&ccedil;as&eacute;'s parsimony made a very inconvenient and unpleasant
trip back for me, milestoned by my few valuable possessions
pawned with suspicious and grasping servicestation
owners.</p>

<p>When I left, a map of the downtown district would have
resembled the profile of a bowl. Now it was a bottle with only a
narrow neck still clear. The weed had flung itself upon Pasadena
and was curving back along Huntington Drive, while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
to the south the opposing pincer was feeling its way along
Soto Street into Boyle Heights. It was only with the greatest
difficulty that I passed through the police lines into the
doomed district.</p>

<p>If I had thought deserted Beverly Boulevard a sad sight
only three days before, what can I say about my impression of
the city's nerve center in its last hours? Abandoned automobiles
stood in the streets at the spot where they had run out
of gas or some minor mechanical failure had halted them.
Dead streetcars, like big game stopped short by the hunter's
bullet, stayed where the failure of electricpower caught them.
The tall buildings reeked of desertion as if their emptying
had dulled some superficial gloss and made them dim and
colorless.</p>

<p>But contrast the dying city with the wall of living green,
north, west, and south, towering ever higher and preparing to
carry out the sentence already passed, and the victim becomes
insignificant in the presence of the executioner. I was reminded
of the well where Gootes died for here except on one
small side the grass rose like the inside of a stovepipe to the
sky; but I suffered neither the same despair nor the unaccountable
elation I had upon that hill, perhaps because the
trough was so much bigger or because the animate thing was
not beneath my feet to communicate those feelings directly.</p>

<p>There had evidently been some looting, not so much from
greed as from the natural impulse of human nature to steal
and act lawlessly as soon as police vigilance is relaxed. Here
and there stores were opened nakedly to the street, their contents
spilled about. But such scenes were surprisingly rare, the
hopelessness of transporting stolen or any other possessions
acting as a greater deterrent than morality. One way or another,
as the saying has it, crime does not pay.</p>

<p>Few people were visible and these were divided sharply
into two categories: those clearly intent upon concluding some
business, rushing furiously, papers, briefcases or articles of
worth in their hands; and those obviously without purpose,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
dazed, listless, stumbling against the curbstones as they
shambled along, casting furtive glances toward the green glacier
in the background.</p>

<p>The newspaper office contained only people of the first
type. Le ffa&ccedil;as&eacute; had come out of his sanctuary for the first time
within memory of anybody on the staff. Still collarless, snuffbox
in hand, he napoleonically directed the removal of those
valuables without which the newspaper could not continue.
He was cool, efficient, seemed to have eyes everywhere and
know everything going on in the entire building. He spent
neither greetings nor reproaches on me, indeed was not looking
in my direction but somehow sensed my presence through
his back, for he said without turning round, "Weener, if you
have concluded your unaccountable peregrinations remove
the two files marked E1925 and E1926 to Pomona. If you
mislay one scrap of paper they contain&mdash;the bartering of a
thousand Weeners being an inadequate equivalent&mdash;your miserable
substance will be attached to four tractors headed in
divergent directions. Don't come back here, but attempt for
once to palliate the offense of your birth and go interview that
Francis female. Interview her, not yourself. Bring back a story,
complete and terse, or commit the first sensible act of your
life with any weapon you choose and charge the instrument
to the <i>Intelligencer</i>."</p>

<p>"I havent the slightest idea where Miss Francis is to be
found."</p>

<p>He took a pinch of snuff, issued orders to four or five other
people and continued calmly, "I am not conducting a school
of journalism; if I were I should have a special duncecap imported
solely for your use. The lowest copyboy knows better
than to utter such an inanity. You will find the Francis and
interview her. I'm busy. Get the hell out of here and handle
those files carefully if you value that cadaver you probably
think of as the repository of your soul."</p>

<p>I am not a drayman and I resented the menial duty of sliding
those heavy filecases down four flights of stairs; but at a
time like this, I thought philosophically, a man has duties he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
cannot shirk; besides, Le ffa&ccedil;as&eacute; was old, I could afford to
humor him even if it meant demeaning myself.</p>

<p>With one of the cases in back, I sadly regarded the other one
occupying most of the front seat. If she had at least given me
her name I would have searched and searched until I found
her. This train of thought reminded me of Le ffa&ccedil;as&eacute;'s command
to find Miss Francis and so I concentrated my attention
on getting away from the <i>Intelligencer</i> office.</p>

<p>It was no light labor; the stalled streetcars and automobiles
presented grave hazards to the unwary. The air smelt of death,
and nervously I pressed the accelerator to get away quickly
from this tomb. I crossed the dry riverbed and made my way
slowly to Pomona, delivered the files, and reluctantly began
seeking Miss Francis.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">28.</span> <span class="num2">I</span>t was practically impossible to discover
any one person among so many scattered and disorganized
people, but chance aided my native intelligence and
perseverance. Only the day before she had been involved with
an indignant group of the homeless who attributed their misfortunes
to her and overcoming their natural American chivalry
toward the weaker sex had tried to revenge themselves.
I was therefore able to locate her, not ten miles from the temporary
headquarters of the <i>Daily Intelligencer</i>.</p>

<p>Her laboratory was an abandoned chickenhouse which
must have reminded her constantly of her lost kitchen. She
looked almost jaunty as she greeted me, a cobweb from the
roof of the decaying shed caught in her hair. "I have no profitable
secrets to market, Weener&mdash;youre wasting your time with
me."</p>

<p>"I am not here as a salesman, Miss Francis," I said. "The
<i>Daily Intelligencer</i> would like to tell its readers how you are
getting on with your search for some cure for the grass."</p>

<p>"You talk as if <i>Cynodon dactylon</i> were a disease. There is no
cure for life but death."</p>

<p>Since she was going to be so touchy about the grass&mdash;as if it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
were a personal possession&mdash;(why, I thought, it's as much mine
as hers)&mdash;I substituted a more diplomatic form of words.</p>

<p>"Well, I have made an interesting discovery," she conceded
grudgingly and pointed to a row of flowerpots, her eyes lighting
as she scanned the single blades of grass perhaps an inch
and a half high growing in each. The sight meant nothing to
me and she must have gathered as much from my expression.</p>

<p>"<i>Cynodon dactylon</i>," she explained, "germinated from
seeds borne by the inoculated plant. Obviously the omnivorous
capacity has not been transmitted to offspring."</p>

<p>This was probably fascinating to her or a gardener or botanist,
but I couldnt see how it concerned me or the <i>Daily Intelligencer</i>.</p>

<p>"It could be a vitamin deficiency," she muttered incomprehensibly,
"or evasion of the laws regarding compulsory education.
These plants indicate the affected grass may propagate
its abnormal condition only through the extension of the already
changed stolons or rhizomes. It means that only the
parent, which is presumably not immortal, is aberrant. The
offspring is no different from the weed householders have
been cursing ever since the Mission Fathers enslaved the Digger
Indians."</p>

<p>"Why, then," I exclaimed, suddenly enlightened, "all we
have to do is wait until the grass dies."</p>

<p>"Or until it meets some insuperable object," supplemented
Miss Francis.</p>

<p>My faith in insuperable objects had been somewhat shaken.
"How long do you think it will be before the grass dies?" I
asked her.</p>

<p>She regarded me gravely, as though I had been a child asking
an absurd question. "Possibly a thousand years."</p>

<p>My enthusiasm was dampened. But after leaving her I remembered
how certain types of people always look for the
dark side of things. It costs no more to be an optimist than a
pessimist; it is sunshine grows flowers, not clouds; and if
Miss Francis chose to think the grass might live a thousand
years, I was equally free to think it might die next week.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
Thus heartened by this bit of homely philosophy, just as valid
as any of the stuff entombed in wordy books, I wrote up my
interview, careful to guide myself by all the stifling strictures
and adjurations impressed upon me by the tyrannically narrowminded
editor. If I may anticipate the order of events, it
appeared next day in almost recognizable form under the
heading, ABNORMAL GRASS TO DIE SOON, SAYS
ORIGINATOR.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">29.</span> <span class="num2">T</span>he small city of Pomona was swollen
to boomtown size by the excursion there of so many enterprises
forced from Los Angeles. Ordinary citizens without
heavy responsibilities when uprooted thought only of putting
as much distance as possible between themselves and their
persecutor; but the officials, the industrialists, the businessmen,
the staffs of great newspapers hovered close by, like small
boys near the knothole in the ballpark fence from which theyd
been banished by an officious cop.</p>

<p>The <i>Intelligencer</i> was lodged over the printshop of a local
tributary which had agreed to the ousting with the most hypocritical
assurances of joy at the honor done them and payment&mdash;in
the smallest possible type&mdash;by the addition to the great
newspaper's masthead of the words, "And Pomona <i>Post-Telegram</i>."</p>

<p>Packed into this inadequate space were the entire staff and
files of the metropolitan daily. No wonder the confusion obviated
all possibility of normal routine. In addition, the disruption
of railroad schedules made the delivery of mail a
hazard rather than a certainty. Perhaps this was why, weeks
after they were due, it was only upon my return from interviewing
Miss Francis I received my checks from the <i>Weekly
Ruminant</i> and the <i>Honeycomb</i>.</p>

<p>It may have been the boomtown atmosphere I have already
mentioned or because at the same time I got my weekly salary;
at any event, moved by an unaccountable impulse I took the
two checks to a barbershop where, perhaps incongruously, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
wellknown firm of Los Angeles stockbrokers had quartered
themselves. I forced the checks upon a troubledlooking individual&mdash;too
taciturn to be mistaken for the barber&mdash;and mumbling,
"Buy me all the shares of Consolidated Pemmican and
Allied Concentrates this will cover," hurried out before sober
thought could cause me to change my mind.</p>

<p>For certainly this was no investment my cool judgment
would approve, but the wildest hunch, causing me to embark
on what was no less than a speculation. I went back to the desk
I shared with ten others, bitterly regretting the things I might
have bought with the money and berating myself for my rashness.
Only the abnormal pressure of events could have made
me yield to so irrational an impulse.</p>

<p>In the meantime things happened fast. Barely had the tardiest
<i>Intelligencer</i> employees got away when the enveloping
jaws of the weed closed tight, catching millions of dollars'
worth of property within. The project to bomb the grass out
of existence, dormant for some weeks, could no longer be
denied.</p>

<p>Even its most ardent advocates, however, now conceded reluctantly
that ordinary explosives would be futile&mdash;more than
futile, an assistance to the growth by scattering the propagating
fragments. For the first time people began talking openly
of using the outlawed atomicbomb.</p>

<p>The instant response to this suggestion was an overwhelming
opposition. The President, Congress, the Army, Navy and
public opinion generally agreed that the weapon was too terrible
to use in so comparatively trivial a cause.</p>

<p>But the machinery for some type of bombing had been set
in motion and had to be used. The fuel was stored, the airfields
jammed, all available planes, new, old, obsolescent and
obsolete assembled, and for three days and nights the great
fleets shuttled backandforth over the jungled area, dropping
thousands of tons of incendiary bombs. Following close behind,
still more planes dropped cargoes of fuel to feed the
colossal bonfire.</p>

<p>Inverted lightning flashes leapt upward, and after them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
great, rolling white, yellow, red and blue flames. The smoke,
the smell of roasting vegetation, the roar and crackle of the
conflagration, and the heat engendered were all noticeable as
far away as Capistrano and Santa Barbara.</p>

<p>Down from the sky, through the surface of the grass, the
incendiaries burned great patches clear to the earth. The
weed, which had resisted fire so contemptuously before, suddenly
became inflammable and burned like celluloid for days.
Miles of twisted stems, cleaned of blade and life, exposed tortured
nakedness to aerial reconnoiter. Bald spots the size of
villages appeared, black and smoldering; the shape of the mass
was altered and altered again, but when, long after, the last
spark flickered out and the last ember grew dull, the grass
itself, torn and injured, but not defeated or even noticeably
beaten back, remained. It had been a brilliant performance&mdash;and
an ineffective one.</p>

<p>The failure of the incendiary bombing not only produced
ruefully triumphant Itoldyousos from disgruntled and doubly
outraged propertyowners, but a new crop of bids for the <i>Intelligencer</i>'s
reward to the developer of a saving agent. From
suggested emigrations to Mars and giant magnifying glasses
set up to wither the grass with the aid of the sun, they ranged
to projects for cutting a canal clear around the weed from San
Francisco Bay to the Colorado River and letting the Pacific
Ocean do the rest. Another solution envisaged shutting off all
light from the grass by means of innumerable radiobeams to
interrupt the sun's rays in the hope that with an inability to
manufacture chlorophyll an atrophy would set in. Several contestants
urged inoculating other grasses, such as bamboo, with
the Metamorphizer, expecting the two giants of vegetation,
like the Kilkenny cats, would end by devouring each other.
This proposal received such wide popular support there is
reason to believe it got some serious consideration in official
quarters, but it was eventually abandoned on the ground that
while it gave only a single slim chance of success it certainly
doubled the potential growths to contend with. The analogy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
of a backfire in forest conflagrations was deemed poetic but
inapplicable.</p>

<p>More comparatively prosaic courses included walling in the
grass with concrete; the Great Wall of China was the only
work of man visible from the moon; were Americans to let
backward China best them? A concrete wall only a mile high
and half a mile thick could be seen by any curious astronomer
on the planet Venus&mdash;assuming Venerians to be afflicted with
terrestrial vices&mdash;and would cost no more than a very small
war, to say nothing of employing thousands who would otherwise
dissipate the taxpayers' money on Relief. A variant of
this plan was to smother the weed with tons of dry cement
and sand from airplanes; the rainy season, due to begin in a
few months, would add the necessary water and the grass
would then be encased in a presumably unbreakable tomb.</p>

<p>But the most popular suggestion embodied the use of salt,
ordinary table salt. From their own experience in backyard
and garden, eager men and women wrote in urging this common
mineral be used to end the menace of the grass. "It will
Kill ennything," wrote an Imperial Valley farmer. "Its lethal
effect on plantlife is instantaneous," agreed a former Beverly
Hills resident. "I know there is not anything like Salt to destroy
Weeds" was part of a long and rambling letter on blueruled
tabletpaper, "In the June of 1926 or 7 I cannot
remember exactly it may have been 28 I accidentally dropped
some Salt on a beautiful Plumbago...."</p>

<p>It was proposed to spray the surface, to drive tunnels
through the roots to conduct brine, to bombard sectors with
sixteeninch guns firing shrapnel loaded with salt, to isolate
by means of a wide saline band the whole territory, both occupied
and threatened. Salt enthusiasts argued that nothing
except a few million tons of an inexpensive mineral would be
wasted if an improbable failure occurred, but if successful in
stopping the advance the country could wait safely behind
its rampart till some weapon to regain the overrun area was
found.</p>

<p>But the salt advocates didnt have everything their own way.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
There arose a bitter antisalt faction taking pleasure at hurling
sneers at these optimistic predictions and delight in demolishing
the arguments. Miss Francis, they said, who ought to know
more about it than anyone else, claimed the grass would break
down even the most stable compound and take what it needed.
Well, salt was a compound, wasnt it? If the prosalt fanatics
had their way they would just be offering food to a hungry
plant. The salt supporters asked what proof Miss Francis had
ever advanced that the plant absorbed everything or indeed
that her Metamorphizer had anything to do with metabolism
and had not merely induced some kind of botanical giantism?
The antisalts, jeering at their enemies as Salinists and
Salinites, promptly threw away Miss Francis' hypothetical
support and relied instead on the proposition that if the salt
were to be efficacious&mdash;an unlikely contingency&mdash;it would have
to reach the roots and if crudeoil, poured on when the plant
was young, had not done so what possible hope could the prosalt
cranks offer for their panacea now the rampant grass was
grown to its present proportions?</p>

<p>The salt argument cut society in half. Learned doctors
battled in the columns of scientific journals. Businessmen dictated
sputtering letters to their secretaries. Housewives wrote
newspapers or argued heatedly in the cornergrocery. Radiocommentators
cautiously skirted the edge of controversy and
more than one enthusiast had to be warned by his sponsor.
Fistfights started in taverns over the question and judicious
bartenders served beer without offering the objectionable
seasoning with it.</p>

<p>The <i>Intelligencer</i>, at the start, was vehemently antisalt. "Is
there an American Cato," Le ffa&ccedil;as&eacute; asked, "to call for the final
ignominy suffered by Carthage to be applied, not to the land
of an enemy, but to our own?" Shortly after this editorial,
entitled "Carthage, California" appeared, the <i>Intelligencer</i>
swung to the opposite side and Le ffa&ccedil;as&eacute; offered the prosalt
argument under the heading "Lot's Wife."</p>

<p>The Daughters of the American Revolution declared themselves
in favor of salt and refused the use of Constitution Hall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
to an antisalt meeting. Stung, the Central Executive Committee
of the Communist party circulated a manifesto declaring
the use of salt was an attempt to encircle, not the grass, for
that was a mere subterfuge of imperialism, but the Soviet
Union; and called upon all its peripheral fringe to write their
congressmen and demonstrate against the saline project. From
India the aged Mohandas Gandhi asked in piping tones why
such a valuable adjunct was to be wasted in rich America while
impoverished ryots paid a harsh tax on this necessity of life?
And the Council of Peoples' Commissars, careless of the action
of the American Stalinists, offered to sell the United States all
its surplus salt. The herringpicklers of Holland struck in a
body while the American salt refiners bid as one to produce
on a costplus basis.</p>

<p>This last was a clincher and the obscurantic antisalts received
the deathblow they richly deserved. The Communist
party reversed themselves swiftly. All respectable and patriotic
people lined up behind salt. With such popular unanimity apparent,
the government could do no less than take heed. A
band twenty miles wide, stretching from Oceanside to the
Salton Sea, from the Salton Sea to the little town of Mojave
and from there to Ventura, was marked out on maps to be
saltsown by the very same bombercommand which had
dropped the spectacular but futile incendiaries. The triumph
of the salt people was ungenerous in its enthusiasm; the disgruntled
antisalts, now a mere handful of diehards publishing
an esoteric press, muttered everyone would be sorry, wait
and see.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">30.</span> <span class="num2">T</span>he grass itself waited for nothing.
It seemed to take new strength from the indignities inflicted
upon it and it increased, if anything, its tempo of growth. It
plunged into the ocean in a dozen spots at once. It swarmed
over sand which had never known anything but cactus and
the Sierra Madres became great humps of green against the
skyline. This last conquest shocked those who had thought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
the mountains immune in their inhospitable heights.
<i>Cynodon dactylon</i>, uninoculated, had always shunned coldness,
though it survived some degrees of frost. The giant
growth, however, seemed to be less subject to this inhibition,
though it too showed slower progress in the higher and colder
regions. The <i>Intelligencer</i> planned to move from Pomona to
San Bernardino and if necessary to Victorville.</p>

<p>Daily Le ffa&ccedil;as&eacute; became a sterner taskmaster, a more pettishly
exacting employer. By the living guts of William Lloyd
Garrison, he raged, had no one ever driven the simple elements
of punctuation into my bloody head? Had no schoolmaster
in moments of heroic enthusiasm attempted to pound
a few rules of rhetoric through my incrassate skull? Had I
never heard of taste? Was the word "style" outside my macilent
vocabulary? What the devil did I mean by standing there
with my mouth open, exposing my unfortunate teeth for all
the world to see? Was it possible for any allegedly human to
be as addlepated as I? And had I been thrust from my mother's
womb&mdash;I suppress his horrible adjectives&mdash;only to torment and
afflict his longsuffering editorial patience?</p>

<p>A hundred times I was tempted to sever my connection with
this journalistic autocrat. My column was widely read and
two publishinghouses had approached me with the idea of putting
out a book, any editorial revision and emendations to
be taken care of by them without disturbing me at all. I could
have allied myself with almost any paper in the country, undoubtedly
at better than the meager stipend Le ffa&ccedil;as&eacute; doled
out to me.</p>

<p>But I think loyalty is one of the most admirable of virtues
and it was not in my nature to desert the <i>Intelligencer</i>&mdash;certainly
not till I could secure a lengthy and ironclad contract,
such as for some reason other papers seemed unwilling to offer
me. In accord with this innate loyalty of mine&mdash;I take no credit
for it, I was born that way&mdash;I did not balk at the assignments
given me though they ranged from the hazardous to the
absurd.</p>

<p>One of the more pleasant of these excursions thought up by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
Mr Le ffa&ccedil;as&eacute; was to fly over the grass and to Catalina, embark
on a chartered boat there and survey the parts of the coast
now overrun. A fresh point of observation. Accompanying
me was the moviecameraman, Rafe Slafe, as uncommunicative
and earnest in his medications as before.</p>

<p>It was a sad sight to see neat rectangular patterns of roads
and highways, cultivated fields and orangegroves, checkered
towns and sprawling suburbs come to an abrupt stop where
they were blotted out by the regimented uniformity of the
onrushing grass. For miles we flew above its dazzling green
until our eyes ached from the sameness and our minds were
dulled from the lack of variety below. On the sea far ahead a
frothing whitecap broke the monotony of color, a flyingfish
jumped out of the water to glisten for a moment in the sun,
loose seaweed floated on the surface, to change in some degree
the intense blue. But here below no alien touch lightened the
unnatural homogeneity. No solitary tree broke this endless
pasture, now healed of the wounds inflicted by the incendiary
bombing, no saltlick, wandering stream or struggling bush
enlivened this prairie. There was not even an odd conformation,
a higher clump here or there, a dead patch to relieve the
unimaginative symmetry. I have read of men going mad in
solitary confinement from looking at the same unchanging
walls; well, here was a solitary cell hundreds of miles in area
and its power to destroy the mind was that much magnified.</p>

<p>I got little consolation from the presence of the others, for
the pilot was engaged in navigation while Slafe was, as ever,
singlemindedly recording mile after mile of the verdant mat
beneath, never pausing nor speaking, though how he justified
the use of so much film when one foot was identical with what
went before and the next, I could not understand.</p>

<p>At last we cleared the awful cancer and flew over the sea. A
thousand variations I had never noticed before offered themselves
to my suddenly refreshed eyes. Not for one split second
was the water the same. Leaping, tossing, spiraling, foaming
back upon itself, making its own shadows and mirroring in an
infinitely faceted glass the sunlight, it changed so constantly it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
was impossible to grasp even a fraction of its mutations. But
Slafe evidently did not share my blessed relief, for he turned
his camera back to catch every last glimpse of the solid green
I was so happy to leave behind.</p>

<p>At the airport, on the way to the boat, on the little vessel
itself, I expected Slafe to relax, to indulge in a conversational
word, to do something to mark him as more than an automaton.
But his actions were confined to using the nasalsyringe,
to exchanging one camera for another, to quizzing the sun
through that absurd lorgnette, and to muttering over cans of
film which he sorted and resorted, always to his inevitable
discontent.</p>

<p>While we waited to start, a perverse fog rolled between us
and the mainland. It made a dramatic curtain over the object
of our visit and emphasized the normality and untouchedness
of Avalon behind us. As the boat got under way, strain my
eyes as I could eastward, not the faintest suggestion of the
ominous outline showed. We sped toward it, cutting the purple
sea into white foam. Slafe was in the bow, customarily
taciturn, the crew were busy. Alone on board I had no immediate
occupation and so I took out my copy of the <i>Intelligencer</i>
and after reading the column which went under my
name and noting the incredible bad taste which had diluted
when it had not excluded everything I had written, I turned
as for consolation to the marketquotations. The Dow-Jones
average was down again, as might be expected since the spread
of the weed had unsettled the delicate balance of the stockmarket.
My eyes automatically ran down the column and over
to the corner where stocks were quoted in cents to reassure
my faith in Consolidated Pemmican and Allied Concentrates.
There it was, immovable through any storm or stress or injudicious
investment by Albert Weener, "CP&amp;AC ... 1/16."</p>

<p>I must have raised my eyes from the newspaper just about
the time the fog lifted. Before us, like the smokewreath accompanying
the discharge of some giant cannon, the green
mass volleyed into the sea. It did not slope gently like a beach<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
or offer a rugged shoulder to be gnawed away as a rocky cliff,
but thundered forward into the surging brine, yielding but
invincible, a landforce potent as the wave itself. Hundreds
of feet into the air it towered, falling abruptly in a sharp wall,
its ends and fringes merging with the surf and wallowing in
happy freedom. The breakers did not batter it for it offered
them no enmity to rage and boil upon, but giving way with
each surge, smothered the eternal anger of the ocean with its
own placid surety.</p>

<p>The seagulls, the helldivers, pelicans, seapigeons had not
been affected. Resting briefly on the weed, they winged out
for their food and returned. It mattered no more to them that
the manmade piers and wharves, the seacoast towns, gypjoints,
rollercoasters, whorehouses, cottages, hotels, streets, gastanks,
quarries, potterykilns, oilfields and factories had been swallowed
up than if some old wreck in the sand, once offering
them foothold, had been taken back by the sea. If I thought
the grass awesome from the land, monotonous from the air,
it seemed eternal from the water.</p>

<p>But impressive as it was from any angle, there were just so
many things I could say about it. My art, unlike Slafe's, not
permitting of endless repetition, I was glad to get back to the
Pomona office, to pad what little copy I had, retire into the
small tent I shared with six other sufferers from the housing
shortage, and attempt some sleep.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">31.</span> <span class="num2">T</span>he course mapped for the saltband
caused almost as much controversy, anguish and denunciation
as the proposal itself. Cities and towns fought to have the saltband
laid between them and the approaching grass, understandably
ignoring larger calculations and considerations.
Cattle ranchers shot at surveying parties and individual farmers
or homeowners fought against having their particular piece
of property covered with salt. The original plan had contemplated
straight lines; eventually the band twisted and turned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
like a typewriter ribbon plagued by a kitten, avoiding not
only natural obstacles, but the domains of those with proper
influence.</p>

<p>Recovery plants worked three shifts a day to pile up great
mounds of the white crystals, which were hauled to the airfields
by trains and trucks. The laden trucks moved over the
highways bumper to bumper; the freighttrains' engines nosed
the cabooses of those in front. All other goods were shunted
on sidings, perishables rotted, valuables went undelivered; all
transportation was reserved for the salt.</p>

<p>Not only was the undertaking unprecedented for its magnitude,
but the urgency and the breakdowns, bottlenecks, shortages
and disruptions caused by the grass itself added to the
formidable accomplishment. But the people were aroused and
aware of danger, and they put almost the same effort behind
the saltsowing as they would have in turning out instruments
of war.</p>

<p>The sowing itself was in a way anticlimactic. By the whim
of Le ffa&ccedil;as&eacute; I went in one of the planes on the first day of the
task. My protests, as always, proving futile, I spent a very
boresome time flying backandforth over the same patch of
ground. That is, it would have been boresome had it not been
for the dangers involved, for in order to sow the salt evenly
and thickly it was necessary to fly low, to hedgehop, the pilot
called it. If the parachutejump had unnerved me, the flying
at terrific speed straight toward a tree, hill or electricpowerline
and then curving upward at the last second to miss them
by a whisper must have put gray in my hair and taken years
from my life.</p>

<p>The rivers, washes and creeks on the inner edge had been
roughly dammed to lessen future erosion of the salt and inappropriately
gay flags marked the boundaries of the area.
Owing to our speed the salt billowed out behind us like
powdery fumes, but beyond the evidence of this smoky trail
we might merely have been a group of madmen confusedly
searching for some object lost upon the ground.</p>

<p>In reporting for the <i>Intelligencer</i> it was impossible to dramatize<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
the event; even the rewritemen were baffled, for under the
enormous head SALT SOWN they could not find enough
copy to carry over from page one.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">32.</span> <span class="num2">T</span>he sowing of the salt went on for
weeks, and the grass leaped forward as if to meet it. It raced
southward through Long Beach, Seal Beach and the deserted
dunes to Newport and Balboa; it came east in a fury through
Puente and Monrovia, northeastward it moved into Lancaster,
Simi and Piru. Only in its course north did the weed show a
slower pace; by the time we had been forced to leave Pomona
for San Bernardino it had got no farther than Calabasas and
Malibu.</p>

<p>The westward migration of the American people was
abruptly reversed. Those actually displaced by the grass infected
others, through whose homes they passed in their flight,
with their own panic. Land values west of the Rockies dropped
to practically nothing and the rich farms of the Great Plains
were worth no more than they had been a hundred years
before. People had seen directly, heard over the radio, or read
in newspapers of the countless methods vainly used to stop the
grass and there was little confidence in the saltband's succeeding
where other devices had failed. True, there were hereandthere
individuals or whole families or even entire communities
obstinate enough to scorn flight, but in the opinion of
most they were like pigheadedly trustful peasants who cling,
in the face of all warning, to homes on the slopes of an active
volcano.</p>

<p>It was generally thought the government itself, in creating
the saltband, was making no more than a gesture. Whatever
the validity of this pessimism, the work itself was impressive.
Viewed from high in the air only a month after the start it
was already visible; after two months it was a thick, glistening
river winding over mountain, desert, and what had been green
fields, a white crystalline barrier behind which the country
waited nervously.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>When the salt had been first proposed, batches had been
dumped in proximity to the grass, but the quantity had been
too small to demonstrate any conclusion and observers had
been immediately driven from the scene of the experiments
by the grass.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the very inclusiveness of these trials confirmed
the doubts of the waiting country as the narrow gap before
the salt was closed and the weed rolled to it near Capistrano.
I would like to think of the meeting as dramatic, heightened
by inaudible drumrolls and flashes of invisible lightning.
Actually the conflict was pedestrian.</p>

<p>Manipulated once more by my tyrant, I was stationed, like
other reporters and radiomen, in a captive balloon. For the
utmost in discomfort and lack of dignity let me recommend
this ludicrous invention. Cramped, seasickened, inconvenienced&mdash;I
don't like to mention this, but provisions for answering
the calls of nature were, to say the least, inadequate&mdash;I
swayed and rocked in that inconsiderable basket, chilled,
blinded by the dazzle of the salt, knocked about by gusts of
irresponsible wind, and generally disgusted by the uselessness
of my pursuit. A telescope to the eye and constant radioreports
from shuttling planes told of the approaching grass, but under
the circumstances weariness rather than excitement or anxiety
was the prevailing emotion.</p>

<p>At last the collision came. The long runners, curiously flat
from the air, pushed their way ahead. The salt seemed no
more to them than bare ground, concrete, vegetation, or any
of the hundred obstacles they had traveled. Unstutteringly
the vinelike stolons went forward. A foot, two, six, ten. No
recoil, no hesitation, no recognition they were traversing a
wall erected against them.</p>

<p>Behind these first outposts, the higher growth came on, and
still farther off the great bulk itself reared skyward, blotting
out the horizon behind, threatening, inexhaustible. It seemed
to prod its precursors, to demand hungrily ever more and
more room to expand.</p>

<p>But the creeping of the runners over the first few feet of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
salt dwindled to a stop. This caused experienced observers
like myself no elation; we had seen it happen many times
before at the encountering of any novel obstacle, and its only
effect had been to make the weed change its tactics in order
to overcome the obstruction, as it did now. A second rank
moved forward on top of the halted first, a third upon the
second and so on till a living wall frowned down upon the salt,
throwing its shadow across it for hundreds of ominous yards.
It towered erect and then, repeating the tactic invariably successful,
it toppled forward to create a bridgehead from which
to launch new assaults.</p>

<p>The next day new stolons emerged from the mass, but now
for the first time excitement seized us up in our bobbing post
of observation. Not only were the new runners visibly shorter
in length but they crept forward more slowly, haltingly, as
though hurt. This impression was generally discredited,
people were surfeited with optimism; they felt our reports
were wishful thinking. Their pessimism seemed to be confirmed
when the weed repeated its action of the day before,
falling ahead of itself upon the salt; and few took stock in
our excited announcements that the grass had covered only
half the previous distance.</p>

<p>Again the probing fingers poked out, again the reserves
piled up, again the mass fell. But it fell far short of a normal
leap. There could no longer be any doubt about it; the advance
had been slowed, almost stopped. The salt was working.</p>

<p>Everywhere along the entire band the story was the same.
The grass rushed confidently in, bit off great chunks, then
smaller, then smaller, until its movement ceased entirely.
That part which embedded itself in the salt lost the dazzling
green color so characteristic and turned piebald, from dirty
gray through brown and yellow, an appearance so familiar
in its normal counterpart on lawns and vacant lots.</p>

<p>The encircled area filled up and choked with the balked
weed. Time after time it essayed the deadly band, only to be
thwarted. The glistening fortification, hardly battered, stood
triumphant, imprisoning the invader within. Commentators<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
in trembling voices broke the joyful news over every receivingset
and even the stodgiest newspapers brought out their
blackest type to announce GRASS STOPPED!</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">33.</span> <span class="num2">T</span>he President of the United States,
as befitted a farmer knowing something of grasses on his own
account, issued a proclamation of thanksgiving for the end of
the peril which had beset the country. The stockmarket recovered
from funereal depths and jumped upward. In all the
great cities hysterical rapture so heated the blood of the people
that all restraints withered. In frantic joy women were raped
in the streets, dozens of banks were looted, thousands of plateglasswindows
were smashed while millions of celebrants wept
tears of 86 proof ecstasy. Torn tickertapes made Broadway
impassable and the smallest whistlestops spontaneously revived
the old custom of uprooting outhouses and perching
them on the church steeple.</p>

<p>I had my own particular reason to rejoice coincident with
the stoppage of the grass. It was so unreal, so dreamlike, that
for many days I had trouble convincing myself of its actuality.
It began with a series of agitated telephone messages from a
firm of stockbrokers asking for my immediate presence, which
because of my assignments, failed to reach me for some time.
So engrossed was I in the events surrounding the victory over
the grass I could not conceive why any broker would want to
see me and so put off my visit several times, till the urgency
of the calls began to pique my curiosity.</p>

<p>The man who greeted me was runcible, with little strands
of sickly hair twisted mopwise over his bald head. His striped
suit was rumpled, the collar of his shirt was wrinkled, and
dots of perspiration stood out on his upperlip and forehead.
"Mr Weener?" he asked. "Oh, thank God, thank God."</p>

<p>Completely at a loss, I followed him into his private office.
"You recall commissioning us&mdash;when we were located in Pomona&mdash;to
purchase some shares of Consolidated Pemmican
and Allied Concentrates for your account?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>To tell the truth, while I had not forgotten the event, I had
been sufficiently ashamed of my rashness to have pushed all
recollection of the transaction to the back of my mind. But I
nodded confirmingly.</p>

<p>"No doubt you would be willing to sell at a handsome
profit?"</p>

<p>Aha, I thought, the rise of the market has sent Consolidated
Pemmican up for once beyond its usual 1/8. I am probably
a rich man and this fellow wants to cheat me of the fruits of
my foresight. "You bought the stock outright?"</p>

<p>"Of course, Mr Weener," he affirmed in a hurt tone.</p>

<p>"Good. Then I will take immediate delivery."</p>

<p>He pulled out a handkerchief and wiped his lip and forehead
with evident inefficiency for the perspiration either remained
or started afresh. "Mr Weener," he said, "I am authorized
to offer you six times&mdash;six times," he echoed impressively,
"the amount of your original investment. This is an amazing
return."</p>

<p>If it was worth it to him, it was worth it to me. "I will take
immediate delivery," I repeated firmly.</p>

<p>"And no brokerage fees involved," he added, as one making
an unbelievable concession.</p>

<p>I shook my head.</p>

<p>"Mr Weener," he said, "I have been empowered to make
you an incredible tender for your stock. Not only will the
boardofdirectors of Consolidated Pemmican return to you six
times the amount of your investment, but they will assign to
you, over and above this price, 49 percent of the company's
votingstock. It is a magnificent and unparalleled bid and I
sincerely advise you to take it."</p>

<p>I pressed my palms into the back of the chair. I, Albert
Weener, was a capitalist. The money involved already seemed
negligible, for it was a mere matter of a few thousand dollars,
but to own what amounted to a controlling interest, even in a
defunct or somnolent corporation, made me an important
person. Only a reflex made me gasp, "I will take immediate
delivery."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>The broker dropped his hands against his thighs. "Mr
Weener, you are an acute man. Mr Weener, I must confess
the truth. You have bought more shares of Consolidated Pemmican
than there are in existence; you not only own the firm,
lock, stock and barrel, but you owe yourself money." He gave
a weak laugh.</p>

<p>"Above and beyond this, Mr Weener, through an unfortunate
series of events due to the confusion of the times&mdash;without
it, such an absurd situation would never have occurred&mdash;several
people: our own firm, our New York correspondents,
and the present heads of Consolidated Pemmican are liable to
prosecution by the Securities Exchange Commission. We can
only throw ourselves on your mercy."</p>

<p>I waved this aside magnanimously. "Where is my property
located?"</p>

<p>"Well, I believe Consolidated Pemmican has an office in
New York."</p>

<p>"Yes, but the factory, the works; where is the product
made?"</p>

<p>"Strictly speaking, I understand active operations ceased
back in 1919. However, there is a plant somewhere in New
Jersey, I think; I'll look it up for you."</p>

<p>My dream of wealth began fading as the whole situation became
clear and suspicions implicit in the peculiar behavior of
the stock were confirmed. The corporation had evidently
fallen into the hands of unscrupulous promoters who manipulated
for the small but steady "take" its fluctuations on the
market afforded. Without attempting to operate the factory,
my reasoning ran, they had taken advantage of the stock's low
price to double whatever they cared to invest twice yearly.
It was a neat and wellshaped little racket and discovery, as
the broker admitted, would have exposed them to legal action.
Only my recklessness with the checks from the <i>Weekly Ruminant</i>
and the <i>Honeycomb</i> had broken the routine.</p>

<p>But ... they had offered me several thousand dollars, evidently
in cold cash. Defunct or not, then, the business was presumably
worth at least that. And if they had employed the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
stock to maintain some sort of income, why, I could certainly
learn to do the same. I was an independent man afterall.</p>

<p>Except for the slightly embarrassing detail of being without
current funds I was also free of Le ffa&ccedil;as&eacute; and the <i>Daily Intelligencer</i>.
"Mr Blank," I said, "I need some money for immediate
expenses."</p>

<p>"I knew youd see things in a sensible light, Weener. I'll
have your check in a minute."</p>

<p>"You misunderstand me. I have no intention of giving up
any part of Consolidated Pemmican."</p>

<p>"Ah?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>He looked at me intently. "Mr. Weener, I am not a wealthy
man. Above and beyond that, since this grass business started,
I assure you any common laborer has made more money than
I. Any common laborer," he repeated sadly.</p>

<p>"Oh, I only need about a thousand dollars for immediate
outlays. Just write me a check for that much, like a good
fellow."</p>

<p>"Mr Weener, how can we be sure you won't call upon us
again for more&mdash;ah&mdash;expensemoney?"</p>

<p>I drew myself up indignantly. "Mr Blank, no one has ever
questioned my integrity before. When I say a thousand dollars
is all the expensemoney I require, why, it is all the expensemoney
I require. To doubt it is to insult me."</p>

<p>"Ah," he said.</p>

<p>"Ah," I agreed.</p>

<p>Reluctantly he wrote the check and handed it to me. Then,
more amicably, we settled the details of the stock transfer and
he gave me the location of my property. I went back to the
<i>Intelligencer</i> office with the springy step of a man who acknowledges
no master. In my mind I prepared a triumph: I
would wait&mdash;even if it took days&mdash;for the first bullying word
from Le ffa&ccedil;as&eacute; and then I would magnificently fling my resignation
in his face.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">34.</span> <span class="num2">W</span>hen the grass was thought to be
invincible, Miss Francis, as the discoverer of the compound
which started it on its course, was the recipient of a universal
if grudging respect. Those whom the grass had made homeless
hated her and would have overcome their natural feeling
of protection toward a woman sufficiently to lynch her if they
could. Men like Senator Jones instinctively disliked her;
others, like Dr Johnson, detested her, but no one thought of
her lightly, even when they glibly coupled the word nut with
her name.</p>

<p>When it was found the saltband worked Miss Francis immediately
became the butt of all the ridicule and contumely
which could be heaped upon her head. What could you expect
of a woman who meddled with things outside her province?
Since she had asserted the grass would absorb everything, its
failure to absorb the salt proved beyond all doubt she was an
ignoramus, a dangerous charlatan, and a crazy woman, better
locked up, who had destroyed Southern California to her own
obscure benefit. The victory over the grass became a victory
over Miss Francis; of the ordinary gumchewing moviegoing
maninthestreet over the pretentious highbrow. She was ignominiously
ejected from her chickenhouse-laboratory on the
ground that it was more needed for its original use, and she
was jeered at in every vehicle of public expression. In spite
of my natural chivalry, I cannot say I pitied her in her fall,
which she took with an unbecoming humility amounting to
arrogance.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">35.</span> <span class="num2">I</span>t was amazing how quickly viewpoints
returned to an apparent normality as soon as the grass
stopped at the saltband. That it still existed, in undisputed
possession of nearly all Southern California after dispersing
and scattering millions of people all over the country, disturbing
by its very being a large part of the national economy, was
only something read in newspapers, an accepted fact to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
pushed into the farthest background of awareness, now the
immediate threat was gone. The salt patrol, vigilant for erosions
or leachings, a select corps, was alert night and day to
keep the saline wall intact. The general attitude, if it concerned
itself at all with the events of the past half year, looked
upon it merely as one of those setbacks periodically afflicting
the country like depressions, epidemics, floods, earthquakes,
or other manmade or natural misfortunes. The United States
had been a great nation when Los Angeles was a pueblo of
five thousand people; the movies could set up in business elsewhere,
Iowans find another spot for senescence, the country
go on much as usual.</p>

<p>One of the first results of the defeat of the grass was the
building, almost overnight, it seemed, of a great city on
the east bank of the Salton Sea. Displaced realtors from the
metropolis found the surrounding mountains ideally suited
for subdivision and laid out romantically named suburbs large
enough to contain the entire population of California before
the site of the city had been completely surveyed. Beyond their
claims, the memorial parks, columbariums, homes of eternal
rest and elysian lawns offered choice lots&mdash;with a special discount
on caskets&mdash;on the installmentplan. Magnificent brochures
were printed, a skeletal biographical dictionary&mdash;$5
for notice, $50 for a portrait&mdash;planned, advertisements in leading
magazines urged the migration of industry: "contented
labor and all local taxes remitted for ten years."</p>

<p>These essential preliminaries accomplished, the city itself
was laid out, watermains installed, and paving and grading
begun. It was no great feat to divert the now aimless Colorado
River aqueduct to the site nor to erect thousands of prefabricated
houses. The climate was declared to be unequalled,
salubrious, equable, pleasant and bracing. Factories were
erected, airports laid out, hospitals, prisons, and insane
asylums built. The Imperial and Coachella valleys shipped
their products in at low cost, and as a gesture to those who
might suffer from homesickness it was called New Los Angeles.</p>

<p>Perhaps in relief from the fear and despair so recently dispelled,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
New Los Angeles began to boom from the moment the
mayor first handed the key to a passing distinguished visitor.
It grew and spread as the grass had grown and spread, the
embryonic skeletons of its unborn skyline rivaled the height
of the green mass now triumphant in its namesake, presenting,
as newsphotographers were quick to see, an aspect from
the west not entirely dissimilar to Manhattan's.</p>

<p>To New Los Angeles, of course, the <i>Daily Intelligencer</i>
moved as soon as a tent large enough to house its presses could
be set up. But I did not move with it. For some reason, perhaps
intuitively forewarned of my intention, Le ffa&ccedil;as&eacute; never gave
me the opportunity to humiliate him as I planned. On the
contrary, I received from him, a few days before the paper's
removal, a silly and characteristic note: "Since the freak grass
has been stopped it seems indicated other abnormalities be
terminated also. Your usefulness to this paper, always debatable,
is now clearly at an end. As of this moment your putative
services will be no longer required. W.R.L."</p>

<p>Bitter vexation came over me at having lost the opportunity
to give this bully a piece of my mind and my impulse was to
go immediately to his office and tell him I scorned his petty
paycheck, but I reflected a man of his nature would merely
find some tricky way of turning the interview to his malicious
satisfaction and he would know soon enough it was the paper
which was suffering a loss and not I.</p>

<p>I started next morning and drove eastward toward my property,
quite satisfied to leave behind forever the scenes of my
early struggles. The West had given me only petty irritations.
In the East, with its older culture and higher level of intelligence,
I looked forward to having my worth appreciated.</p>

<h3>Man Triumphant ... II</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">36.</span> <span class="num2">E</span>verything I had visualized in the
broker's office turned out too pessimistically accurate. Consolidated
Pemmican and Allied Concentrates was nothing but
a mailing address in one of the most forlorn of Manhattan
buildings, long before jettisoned by the tide of commerce. The
factory, no bigger than a very small house, was a brokenwindowed
affair whose solid brick construction alone saved it
from total demolition at the playful hands of the local children.
The roof had long since fallen in and symbolical grass
and weeds had pushed their way through cracks in the floor
to flourish in a sickly and surreptitious way.</p>

<p>The whole concern, until my stock purchase, had been the
chattel and creature of one Button Gwynnet Fles. In appearance
he was such a genuine Yankee, lean and sharp, with a
slight stoop and prying eyes, that one quite expected a straw
to protrude from between his thin lips or have him draw from
his pocket a wooden nutmeg and offer it for sale. After getting
to know him I learned this apparent shrewdness was a
pure defense mechanism, that he was really an artless and ingenuous
soul who had been taught by other hands the swindle
he practiced for many years and had merely continued it because
he knew no way of making an honest living. He was,
like myself, unattached, and disarmed whatever lingering
suspicions of him I might have by offering to share his quarters
with me until I should have found suitable accommodations.</p>

<p>The poor fellow was completely at my mercy and I not only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
forbore, generously, to press my advantage, but made him
vicepresident of the newly reorganized concern, permitting
him to buy back a portion of the stock he had sold. The boom
in the market having sent our shares up to an abnormal 1/2,
we flooded our brokers with selling offers, at the same time
spreading rumors&mdash;by no means exaggerated&mdash;of the firm's instability,
buying back control when Consolidated Pemmican
reached its norm of 1/16. We made no fortunes on this transaction,
but I was enabled to look ahead to a year on a more
comfortable economic level than ever before.</p>

<p>But it was by no means in my plans merely to continue to
milk the corporation. I am, I hope, not without vision, and I
saw Consolidated Pemmican under my direction turned into
an active and flourishing industry. Its very decrepitude, I
reasoned, was my opportunity; starting from scratch and working
with nothing, I would build a substantial structure.</p>

<p>One of the new businesses which had sprung up was that of
personally conducted tours of the grass. After the experience
of Gootes and myself, parachute landings had been ruled out
as too hazardous, but someone happily thought of the use of
snowshoes and it was on these clumsy means that tourists, at
a high cost and at less than snail's pace, tramped wonderingly
over the tamed menace.</p>

<p>My thought then, as I explained to Fles, was to reactivate
the factory and sell my product to the sightseers. Food, high
in calories and small in bulk, was a necessity on their excursions
and nourishing pemmican high in protein quickly replaced
the cloying and messy candybar. We made no profit,
but we suffered no loss and the factory was in actual operation
so that no snoopers could ever accuse us of selling stock in an
enterprise with a purely imaginary existence.</p>

<p>I liked New York; it accorded well with my temperament
and I wondered how I had ever endured those weary years
far from the center of the country's financial life, its theaters
and its great human drama. Give me the old Times Square
and the East Fifties any day and you can keep Death Valley and
functional architecture. I was at home at last and I foresaw<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
a future of slow but sure progress toward a position of
eminence and respectability. The undignified days of Miss
Francis and Le ffa&ccedil;as&eacute; faded from my mind and I was aware
of the grass only as a cause for selling our excellent pemmican.</p>

<p>I won't say I didnt read the occasional accounts of the weed
appearing in <i>Time</i> or the newspapers, or watch films of it in
the movies with more than common interest, but it was no
longer an engrossing factor in my life. I was now taken up with
larger concerns, working furiously to expand my success and
for a year after leaving the <i>Intelligencer</i> I doubt if I gave it
more than a minute's thought a day.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">37.</span> <span class="num2">T</span>he band of salt remained an impregnable
bulwark. Where the winter rains leached it, new tons
of the mineral replaced those washed away. Constant observation
showed no advance; if anything the edge of the grass impinging
directly on the salt was sullenly retreating. The central
bulk remained, a vast, obstinate mass, but most people
thought it would somehow end by consuming itself, if indeed
this doom were not anticipated by fresh scatterings of salt
striking at its vitals as soon as the rains ceased.</p>

<p>No more than any other reader, then, was I disquieted by
the following small item in my morning paper:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="center">FREAK WEED STIRS SPECULATION</p>

<p>San Diego, Mar 7. (AP) An unusual patch of
Bermuda grass discovered growing in one of the
city parks' flower beds here today caused an excited
flurry among observers. Reaching to a
height of nearly four feet and defying all efforts
of the park gardeners to uproot it, the vivid
green interloper reminded fearful spectators of
the plague which over ran Los Angeles two years
ago. Scientists were reassuring, however, as they
pointed out that the giantism of the Los Angeles
devil grass was not transmissible by seed and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
that no stolons or rhizomes of the abnormal
plant had any means of traveling to San Diego,
protected as it is by the band of salt confining
the Los Angeles growth.</p></div>

<p>I was even more confident, for I had seen with my own eyes
the shoots grown by Miss Francis from seeds of the inoculated
plant. A genuine freak, this time, I thought, and promptly
forgot the item.</p>

<p>Would have forgotten it, I should say, had I not an hour
later received a telegram, RETURN INSTANTLY CAN
USE YOUR IMPRESSIONS OF NEW GRASS LEFFACASE.
I knew from the fact he had only used nine of the ten
words paid for he considered the situation serious.</p>

<p>The answer prompted by impulse would, I knew, not be
transmitted by the telegraph company and on second thought
I saw no reason why I should not take advantage of the
editor's need. Business was slack and I was overworked; a succession
of petty annoyances had driven me almost to a nervous
breakdown and a vacation at the expense of the New Los
Angeles <i>Daily Intelligencer</i> sounded pleasantly restful after
the serious work of grappling with industrial affairs. Of course
I did not need their paltry few dollars, but at the moment
some of my assets were frozen and a weekly paycheck would
be temporarily convenient, saving me the bother of liquidating
a portion of my smaller investments.</p>

<p>Besides, if, as was barely possible, this new growth was in
some unbelievable way an extension of the old, it would of
course ruin our sales of pemmican to the tourists and it behooved
me to be on the spot. I therefore answered: CONSIDER
DOUBLE FORMER SALARY WIRE TRANSPORTATION.
Next day the great transcontinental plane
pouterpigeoned along the runway of the magnificent New Los
Angeles airport.</p>

<p>I was in no great hurry to see the editor, but took a taxi
instead to the headquarters of the American Alpinists Incorporated
where there was frank worry over the news and acknowledgment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
that no further consignments of pemmican
would be accepted until the situation became more settled.
I left their offices in a thoughtful mood. Pausing only to wire
Fles to unload as much stock as he could&mdash;for even if this were
only a temporary scare it would undoubtedly affect the market&mdash;I
finally drove to the <i>Intelligencer</i>.</p>

<p>Knowing Le ffa&ccedil;as&eacute; I hardly expected to be received with
either cordiality or politeness, but I was not quite prepared
for the actual salute. A replica of his original office had been
devised, even to the shabby letters on the door, and he was
seated in his chair beneath the gallery of cartoons. He began
calmly enough when I entered, speaking in a low, almost
gentle tone, helping himself to snuff between sentences, but
gradually working up into a quite artistic crescendo.</p>

<p>"Ah, Weener, as you yourself would undoubtedly put it in
your inimitable way, a bad penny always turns up. I could not
say <i>canis revertit suam vomitem</i>, for it would invert a relationship&mdash;the
puke has returned to the dog.</p>

<p>"It is a sad thought that the listless exercise which eventuated
in your begetting was indulged in by two whose genes and
chromosomes united to produce a male rather than a female
child. For think, Weener, if you had been born a woman, with
what gusto would you have peddled your flaccid flesh upon the
city streets and offered your miserable dogsbody to the reluctant
use of undiscriminating customers. You are the paradigmatic
whore, Weener, and I weep for the physiological accident
which condemns you to sell your servility rather than
your vulva. Ah, Weener, it restores my faith in human depravity
to have you around to attempt your petty confidence
tricks on me once more; I rejoice to find I had not overestimated
mankind as long as I can see one aspect of it embodied
in your 'homely face and bad complexion,' as the great Gilbert
so mildly put it. I shall give orders to triplelock the pettycash,
to count the stampmoney diligently, to watch all checks for
inept forgery. Welcome back to the <i>Intelligencer</i> and be grateful
for nature's mistakes, since they afford you employment as
well as existence.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>"But enough of the friendly garrulousness of an old man
whose powers are failing. Remove your unwholesomelooking
person from my sight and convey the decrepit vehicle of your
spirit to San Diego. It is but a gesture; I expect no coherent
words from your clogged and sputtery pen; but while I am
sufficiently like yourself to deceive the public into thinking
you have written what they read, I am not yet great enough
scoundrel to do so without your visiting the scene of your presumed
labors. Go&mdash;and do not stop on the way to draw expensemoney
from the cashier for she has strict orders not to pay it."</p>

<p>Jealousy, nothing but jealousy, I thought, first of my literary
ability and now of my independence of his crazy whims.
I turned my back deliberately and walked slowly out, to show
my contempt for his rantings.</p>

<p>In my heart, now, there was little doubt the new grass was
an extension of the old and it didnt take more than a single
look at the overrun park to confirm this. The same creeping
runners growing perceptibly from instant to instant, the same
brilliant color, the same towering central mass gorged with
food. I could have described it line by line and blade by blade
in my sleep. I wasted no more time gazing at it, but hurried
away after hardly more than a minute's inspection.</p>

<p>I could take no credit for my perceptivity since everyone in
San Diego knew as well as I that this was no duplicate freak,
but the same, the identical, the fearsome grass. But a quite
understandable conspiracy had been tacitly entered into; the
knowledge was successfully hushed until property could be
disposed of before it became quite worthless. The conspiracy
defeated itself, however, with so many frantic sellers competing
against each other and the news was out by the time the
first of my new columns appeared in the <i>Intelligencer</i>.</p>

<p>The first question which occurred to those of us calm enough
to escape panic was, how had the weed jumped the saltband?
It was answered simultaneously by many learned professors
whose desire to break into print and share the front page with
the terrible grass overcame their natural academic reticence.
There was no doubt that originally the peculiar voracity of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
the inoculated plant had not been inherited; but it was equally
uncontroverted that somehow, during the period it had been
halted by the salt, a mutation had happened and now every
wind blowing over the weed carried seeds no longer innocent
but bearing embryos of the destroyer.</p>

<p>Terror ran before the grass like a herald. The shock felt
when Los Angeles went down was multiplied tenfold. Now
there was no predictable course men could shape their actions
to avoid. No longer was it possible to watch and chart the daily
advance of a single body so a partially accurate picture could
be formed of what might be expected tomorrow. Instead of
one mass there were countless ones; at the whim of a chance
wind or bird, seeds might alight in an area apparently safe and
overwhelm a community miles away from the living glacier.
No place was out of range of the attack; no square foot of land
kept any value.</p>

<p>The stockmarket crashed, and I congratulated myself on
having sent Fles orders to sell. A day or two later the exchanges
were closed and, shortly after, the banks. Business came to a
practical standstill. The great industries shut down and all
normal transactions of daily life were conducted by means of
barter. For the first time in threequarters of a century the
farmer was topdog; his eggs and milk, his wheat and corn and
potatoes he could exchange for whatever he fancied and on his
own terms. Fortunately for starving citydwellers his appetite
for manufactured articles and for luxuries was insatiable; their
automobiles, furcoats, costumejewelry, washingmachines, files
of the <i>National Geographic</i>, and their periodfurniture left the
city flat for the farm, to come back in the more acceptable form
of steaks, butter, fowl, and turnips. The whole elaborate structure
of money and credit seemed to disappear overnight like
some tenuous dream.</p>

<p>The frenzied actions of the humanbeings had no effect on
the grass. The saltband still stood inviolate, as did smaller
counterparts hastily laid around the earlier of the seedborne
growths, but everywhere else the grass swept ahead like a tidalwave,
its speed seemingly increased by the months of repression<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
behind. It swallowed San Diego in a gulp and leaped beyond
the United States to take in Baja California in one swift
downward lick. It sprang upon the deserts, whose lack of
water was no deterrent, now always sending little groups
ahead like paratroopers or fifthcolumnists; they established
positions till the main body came up and consolidated them.
It curled up the high mountains, leaving only the snow on
their peaks unmolested and it jumped over struggling rivers
with the dexterity of a girl playing hopscotch.</p>

<p>It lunged eastward into Arizona and Nevada, it swarmed
north up the San Joaquin Valley through Fresno and spilled
over the lip of the High Sierras toward Lake Tahoe. New Los
Angeles, its back protected by the Salton Sea, was, like the
original one, subjected to a pincer movement which strangled
the promising life from it before it was two years old.</p>

<p>Forced to move again, Le ffa&ccedil;as&eacute; characteristically demanded
the burden fall upon the employees of the paper, paying
them off in scrip on the poor excuse that no money was
available. I saw no future in staying with this sinking ship
and eager to be back at the center of things&mdash;Fles wrote me
that the large stock of pemmican which had been accumulating
without buyers could now be very profitably disposed of&mdash;I
severed my connection for the second time with the <i>Intelligencer</i>
and returned to my proper sphere.</p>

<p>This of course did not mean that I failed to follow each step
of the grass; such a course would have been quite impossible
since its every move affected the life and fortune of every
citizen. By some strange freak it spared the entire coast north
of Santa Barbara. Whether it had some disinclination to approach
saltwater&mdash;it had been notably slow in its original advance
westward&mdash;or whether it was sheer accident, San Luis
Obispo, Monterey and San Francisco remained untouched as
the cities to the south and east were buried under grassy
avalanches. This odd mercy raised queer hopes in some: perhaps
their town or their state would be saved.</p>

<p>The prostration of the country which had begun with the
first wave of panic could not be allowed to continue. The government<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
moved in and seized, first the banks and then the railroads.
Abandoned realestate was declared forfeit and opened
to homesteading. Prices were pegged and farmers forced to
pay taxes in produce.</p>

<p>Although these measures restored a similitude of life to the
nation, it remained but a feeble imitation of its previous self.
Many of the idle factories failed to reopen, others moved with
painful caution. Goods, already scarce, disappeared almost
completely and at the same time a reckless disregard of formerly
sacred symbols seized upon the people. The grass was
coming, so what good was the lot on which they were paying
installments? The grass was coming, so why gather together
the dollars to meet the interest on the mortgage? The grass
was coming&mdash;what was the use of depositing money in the bank
which would probably go bust tomorrow?</p>

<p>The inflation would have been worse had it not been for
the pegged prices and other stern measures. The glut on the
labor market was tremendous and wages reached the vanishing
point in a currency which would buy little. Suddenly, the
United States, which had so long boasted of being the richest
country in the world, found itself desperately poor.</p>

<p>Government work projects did little to relieve the suffering
of the proletariat. Deaths from malnutrition mounted and the
feeble strikes in the few operating industries were easily and
quickly crushed by starving strikebreakers ashamed of their
deed yet desperately eager to feed their hungry families. Riots
broke out in New York and Detroit, but the police were fortunately
wellfed and the arms wielding the blackjacks which
crushed the skulls of the undernourished rioters were stout.</p>

<p>There was a sweeping revival of organized religion and men
too broke to afford the neighborhood movie flocked to the
churches. Brother Paul, now on a national hookup, repeated
his exhortations to all Christians, urging them to join their
Savior in the midst of the grass. There was great agitation for
restraining him; more reserved pastors pointed out that he
was responsible for increasing the national suicide rate, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
the Federal Communications Commission took no action
against him, possibly because, as some said, it was cheaper to
let a percentage of the surplus population find an ecstatic
death than to feed it.</p>

<p>On political maps the United States had lost not one foot of
territory. Population statistics showed it harbored as many
men, women, and children as before. Not one tenth of the
national wealth had been destroyed by the grass or a sixth of
the country given up to it, yet it had done what seven wars and
many vicissitudes had failed to do: it brought the country to
the nadir of its existence, to a hopeless despondency unknown
at Valley Forge.</p>

<p>At this desperate point the federal government decided it
could no longer temporize with the clamor for using atomic
power against the grass. All the arguments so weighty at first
became insignificant against the insolent facts. It was announced
in a Washington pressconference that as soon as
arrangements could be made the most fearful of all weapons
would be employed.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">38.</span> <span class="num2">N</span>o one doubted the atomicbomb
would do the trick, finally and conclusively. The searing, volcanic
heat, irresistible penetration, efficient destructiveness
and the aftermath of apocalyptic radiation promised the end
of the grass.</p>

<p>When I say no one, of course I mean no clearthinking person
of vision with his feet on the ground who didnt go deliberately
out of his way to look for the dark side of things.
Naturally there were crackpots, as there always are, who opposed
the use of the bomb for various untenable reasons, and
among them I was not surprised to find Miss Francis.</p>

<p>Though her pessimistic and unpopular opinions had been
discredited time and again, the newspapers, possibly to enliven
their now perpetually gloomy columns with a little
humor, gave some space to interviews which, with variations
predicated on editorial policy, ran something like this:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>Will you tell our readers what you think of using the atom
bomb against the grass?</p>

<p>I think it at the very best a waste of time; at the worst, extremely
dangerous.</p>

<p>In what way, Miss Francis?</p>

<p>In every way. Did you ever hear of a chain-reaction, young
man? Or radioactivity? Can you conceive, among other possibilities&mdash;and
mind, this is merely a possibility, a quite unscientific
guess merely advanced in the vain hope of avoiding
one more folly&mdash;of the whole mass becoming radioactive,
squaring or cubing its speed of growth, or perhaps throwing
before it a lethal band miles wide? Mind you, I'm not anticipating
any of this, not even saying it is a probability; but
these or similar hazards may well attend this illconsidered
venture.</p>

<p>You speak strongly, Miss Francis. None of the rather fantastic
things you predict followed Hiroshima, Nagasaki or
Bikini.</p>

<p>In the first place, I tried, with apparent unsuccess, to make
it clear I'm not predicting. I am merely mentioning possibilities.
In the second place, we don't know exactly what were
the aftereffects of the previous bombs because of a general
inability to correlate cause and effect. I only know that in
every case the use of the atomic bomb has been followed at
greater or lesser intervals by tidal waves, earthquakes and
other 'natural' phenomena. Now do not quote me as saying
the Hilo tidal wave was the result of the Nagasaki bomb or the
Chicagku earthquake, the Bikini; for I didnt. I only point out
that they followed at roughly equal intervals.</p>

<p>Then you are opposed to the bomb?</p>

<p>Common sense is. Not that that will be a deterrent.</p>

<p>What would you substitute for it?</p>

<p>If I had a counteragent to the grass ready I would not be
wasting time talking to reporters. I am working on one. When
it is found, by me or another, it will be a true counteragent,
changing the very structure and habit of <i>Cynodon dactylon</i>
as the Metamorphizer changed it originally. External weapons,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
by definition, can at best, at the very best, merely stop the grass&mdash;not
render it innocuous. Equals fighting equals produce
only deadlocks.</p></div>

<p>And so on. The few reputable scientists who condescended
to answer her at all and didnt treat her views with dignified
silence quickly demonstrated the absurdity of her objections.
Chainreactions and radioactive advanceguard! Sundaysupplement
stuff, without the slightest basis of reasoning; not a
mathematical symbol or laboratory experiment to back up
these fictional nightmares. And not use external weapons,
indeed! Was the grass to be hypnotized then? Or made to
change its behaviorpatterns through judicious sessions with
psychoanalysts stationed along its periphery?</p>

<p>Whether because of Miss Francis' prophesies or not, it
would be futile to deny that a certain amount of trepidation
accompanied the decision to use the bomb. Residents of Arizona
wanted it dropped in California; San Franciscans urged
the poetic justice and great utility of applying it to the very
spot where the growth originated; all were in favor of the
devastation at the farthest possible distance from themselves.</p>

<p>Partly in response to this pressure and partly in consideration
of other factors, including the possibility of international
repercussions, the Commission to Combat Dangerous Vegetation
decided on one of the least awesome bombs in the catalogue.
Just a little bomb&mdash;hardly more than a toy, a plaything,
the very smallest practicable&mdash;ought to allay all fears and set
everyone's mind at rest. If it were effective, a bigger one could
be employed, or numbers of smaller ones.</p>

<p>This much being settled, there was still the question of
where to initiate the attack. Edge or heart? Once more there
was controversy, but it lacked the enthusiasm remembered
by veterans of the salt argument; a certain lassitude in debate
was evident as though too much excitement had been dissipated
on earlier hopes, leaving none for this one. There was
little grumbling or soreness when the decision was finally
confirmed to let fall the bomb on what had been Long Beach.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>When I read of the elaborate preparations being made to
cover the great event, of the special writers, experts, broadcasters,
cameramen, I was thankful indeed I was no longer a
newspaperman, arbitrarily to be ordered aloft or sent aboard
some erratic craft offshore on the bare chance I might catch a
comprehensive or distinctive enough glance of the action to
repay an editor for my discomfort. Instead, I sat contentedly
in my apartment and listened to the radio.</p>

<p>Whether our expectations had been too high or whether
all the eyewitnesses became simultaneously inept, I must say
the spot broadcast and later newspaper and magazine accounts
were uniformly disappointing. It was like the hundredth
repetition of an oftentold story. The flash, the chaos,
the mushroomcloud, the reverberation were all in precise
order; nothing new, nothing startling, and I imagine the rest
of the country, as I did, turned away from the radio with a
distinct feeling of having been let down.</p>

<p>First observation through telescope and by airplanes keeping
a necessarily cautious distance, showed the bomb had
destroyed a patch of vegetation about as large as had been
expected. Though not spectacular, the bombing had apparently
been effective on a comparatively small segment and it
was anticipated that as soon as it was safe to come close and
confirm this, the action would be repeated on a larger scale.
While hundreds more of the baby bombs, as they were now
affectionately called, were ordered and preparations made
systematically to blast the grass out of existence, the aerial
observers kept swooping in closer and closer with cameras
trained to catch every aspect of the damage.</p>

<p>There was no doubt an area of approximately four square
miles had been utterly cleaned of the weed and a further zone
nine times that size had been smashed and riven, the grass
there torn and mangled&mdash;in all probability deprived of life.
Successive reconnoitering showed no changes in the annihilated
center, but on the tenth day after the explosion a most
startling observation of the peripheral region was made. It had
turned a brilliant orange.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>Not a brown or yellow, or any of the various shades of decay
which Bermuda in its original form took on at times, but a
glowing and unearthly, jewellike blaze.</p>

<p>The strange color was strictly confined to the devastated
edge of the bombcrater; airmen flying low could see its distinction
from the rest of the mass clear and sharp. In the
center, nothing; around it, the weird orange; and beyond, the
usual and accustomed green.</p>

<p>But on second look, not quite usual, not quite accustomed.
The inoculated grass had always been a shade or two more
intense than ordinary <i>Cynodon dactylon</i>; this, just beyond the
orange, was still more brilliant. Not only that, but it behaved
unaccountably. It writhed and spumed upward in great
clumps, culminating in enormous, overhanging caps inevitably
suggesting the mushroomcloud of the bomb.</p>

<p>The grass had always been cautious of the sea; now the
dazzling growth plunged into the saltwater with frenzy, leaping
and building upon itself. Great masses of vegetation, piers,
causeways, isthmuses of grass offered the illusion of growing
out of the ocean bottom, linking themselves to the land, extending
too late the lost coast far out into the Pacific.</p>

<p>But this was far from the last aftereffect. Though attention
had naturally been diverted from the orange band to the eccentric
behavior of the contiguous grass, it did not go unobserved
and about a week after its first change of color it seemed to be
losing its unnatural hue and turning green again.</p>

<p>Not the green of the great mass, nor of the queer periphery,
nor of uninspired devilgrass. It was a green unknown in living
plant before; a glassy, translucent green, the green of a cathedral
window in the moonlight. By contrast, the widening circle
about it seemed subdued and orderly. The fantastic shapes,
the tortured writhings, the unnatural extensions into the
ocean were no longer manifest, instead, for miles around the
ravaged spot where the bomb had been dropped, the grass
burst into bloom. Purple flowers appeared&mdash;not the usual
muddy brown, faintly mauve&mdash;but a redviolet, brilliant and
clear. The period of generation was abnormally shortened;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
seed was borne almost instantly&mdash;but the seed was a sport.</p>

<p>It did not droop and detach itself and sink into the ground.
Instead, tufted and fluffy, like dandelion seed or thistledown,
it floated upward in incredible quantities, so that for hundreds
of miles the sky was obscured by this cloud bearing the germ
of the inoculated grass.</p>

<p>It drifted easily and the winds blew it beyond the confines
of the creeping parent. It lit on spots far from the threatening
advance and sprouted overnight into great clumps of devilgrass.
All the anxiety and panic which had gone before was
trivial in the face of this new threat. Now the advance was no
longer calculable or predictable; at any moment a spot apparently
beyond danger might be threatened and attacked.</p>

<p>Immediately men remembered the exotic growth of flowers
which came up to hide some of London's scars after the blitz
and the lush plantlife observed in Hiroshima. Why hadnt the
allwise scientists remembered and taken them into account
before the bomb was dropped? Why had they been blind to
this obvious danger? Fortunately the anger and terror were
assuaged. Observers soon discovered the mutants were sterile,
incapable of reproduction. More than that: though the new
clumps spread and flourished and grew rapidly, they lacked
the tenacity and stamina of the parent. Eventually they withered
and dwindled and were in the end no different from the
uninoculated grass.</p>

<p>Now a third change was seen in the color band. The green
turned distinctly blue and the sharp line between it and the
rest of the weed vanished as the blueness shaded out imperceptibly
over miles into the green. The barren spot made by
the bomb was covered; the whole mass of vegetation, thousands
of square miles of it, was animated by a surging new
vigor, so that eastward and southward the rampant tentacles
jumped to capture and occupy great new swaths of territory.</p>

<p>Triumphantly Brother Paul castigated the bombardiers and
urged repentance for the blasphemy to avert further welldeserved
punishment. Grudgingly, one or two papers recalled
Miss Francis' warning. Churches opened their doors on special<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
days of humiliation and fasting. But for most of the people
there was a general feeling of relief; the ultimate in
weapons had been used; the grass would wear itself out in
good time; meanwhile, they were thankful the effect of the
atomicbomb had been no worse. If anything the spirit of the
country, despite the great setback, was better after the dropping
of the bomb than before.</p>

<p>I was so fascinated by the entire episode that I stayed by my
radio practically all my waking hours, much to the distress of
Button Fles. Every report, every scrap of news interested me.
So it was that I caught an item in a newscast, probably unheard
by most, or smiled aside, if heard. <i>Red Egg</i>, organ of the Russian
Poultry Farmers, editorialized, "a certain imperialist
nation, unscrupulously pilfering the technical advance of
Soviet Science, is using atomic power, contrary to international
law. This is intolerable to a peace-loving people embracing
1/6 of the earth's surface and the poultrymen of the Collective,
<i>Little Red Father</i>, have unanimously protested against
such capitalist aggression which can only be directed against
the Soviet Union."</p>

<p>The following day, <i>Red Star</i> agreed; on the next, <i>Pravda</i>
reviewed the "threatening situation." Two days later <i>Izvestia</i>
devoted a column to "Blackmail, Peter the Great, Suvarov
and Imperialist Slyness." Twentyfour hours after, the Ministerial
Council of the Union of Soviet Republics declared a
state of war existed&mdash;through no action of its own&mdash;between the
United States and the Soviet Union.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">39.</span> <span class="num2">A</span>t first the people were incredulous.
They could not believe the radio reports were anything but a
ghastly mistake, an accidental garbling produced by atmospheric
conditions. Historians had told them from their schooldays
of traditional Russian-American friendship. The Russian
Fleet came to the Atlantic coast in 1862 to escape revolutionary
infection, but the Americans innocently took it as a gesture
of solidarity in the Civil War. The Communist party had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
repeated with the monotony of a popular hymntune at a revival
that the Soviet Union asked only to be let alone, that it
had no belligerent designs, that it was, as Lincoln said of the
modest farmer, desirous only of the land that "jines mine."
At no point were the two nations' territories contiguous.</p>

<p>Agitators were promptly jailed for saying the Soviet Union
wasnt&mdash;if it ever had been&mdash;a socialist country; its imperialism
stemming directly from its rejection of the socialist idea. As a
great imperialist power bursting with natural resources it must
inevitably conflict with the other great imperialist power. In
our might we had done what we could to thwart Russian ambition;
now they seized the opportunity to disable a rival.</p>

<p>Congressmen and senators shredded the air of their respective
chambers with screams of outrage. In every speech, "Stab
in the back" found an honorable if monotonous place. Zhadanov,
boss of the Soviet Union since the death of the sainted
Stalin, answered gruffly, "War is no minuet. We do not wait
for the capitalist pigs to bow politely before we rise to defend
the heritage of Czar Ivan and our own dear, glorious, inspiring,
venerated Stalin. Stab in the back! We will stab the fascist
lackeys of Morgan, Rockefeller and Jack and Heinze in whatever
portion of the anatomy they present to us."</p>

<p>As usual, the recurring prophets who hold their seances
between hostilities and invariably predict a quick, decisive
war&mdash;in 1861 they gave it six weeks; in 1914 they gave it six
weeks; in 1941 they gave it six weeks&mdash;were proved wrong.
They had been overweeningly sure this time: rockets, guided
missiles or great fleets of planes would sweep across the skies
and devastate the belligerents within three hours of the declaration
of war&mdash;which of course would be dispensed with. Not
a building would remain intact in the great cities nor hardly a
civilian alive.</p>

<p>But three hours after Elmer Davis&mdash;heading an immediately
revived Office of War Information&mdash;announced the news in
his famous monotone, New York and Chicago and Seattle were
still standing and so, three days later, were Moscow and Leningrad
and Vladivostok.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>Astonishment and unbelief were nationwide. The Empire
State, the Palmolive Building, the Mark Hopkins&mdash;all still
intact? Only when commentators, rummaging nervously
among old manuscripts, recalled the solemn gentlemen's
agreement never to use heavierthanaircraft of any description
should the unthinkable war come, did the public give a heartfelt
sigh of relief. Of course! Both the Soviet Union and the
United States were nations of unstained honor and, rather
than recall their pledged word, would have suffered the loss of
a dozen wars. Everyone breathed easier, necks relaxed from the
strain of scanning the skies; there would be neither bombs,
rockets, nor guided missiles in this war.</p>

<p>As soon as the conviction was established that the country
was safe from the memory of Hiroshima, panic gave place to
relief and for the first time some of the old spirit was manifest.
There was no rush to recruitingstations, but selectiveservice,
operating smoothly except in the extreme West, took care of
mobilization and the war was accepted, if not with enthusiasm,
at least as an inescapable fate.</p>

<p>The coming of the grass had not depleted nor unbalanced
the country's resources beyond readjustment, but it had upset
the sensitive workings of the national economy. This was tolerable
by a sick land&mdash;and the grass had made the nation sick&mdash;in
peacetime; but "war is the health of the state" and the
President moved quickly.</p>

<p>All large industries were immediately seized, as were the
mines and means of transportation. A basic fiftyfivehour workweek
was imposed. A new chief of staff and of naval operations
was appointed and the young men went off to camp to train
either for implementing or repelling invasion. Then came a
period of quiet during which both countries attacked each
other ferociously over the radio.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">40.</span> <span class="num2">I</span>n the socialistic orgy of nationalizing
business, I was fortunate; Consolidated Pemmican and
Allied Concentrates was left in the hands of private initiative.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
Better than that, it had not been tied down and made helpless
by the multiplicity of regulations hampering the few types of
endeavor remaining nominally free of regimenting bureaucracy.
Opportunity, long prepared for and not, I trust, undeserved,
was before me.</p>

<p>In the pass to which our country had come it seemed to me
I could be of most service supplying our armed forces with
fieldrations. Such an unselfish and patriotic desire one would
think easy of realization&mdash;as I so innocently did&mdash;and I immediately
began interviewing numberless officers of the Quartermaster's
Department to further this worthy aim.</p>

<p>I certainly believe every corporation must have its rules,
otherwise executives would be besieged all day by timewasters.
The United States government is surely a corporation, as I
always used to say in advocating election of a business administration,
and standard procedures and regulations are essential.
Still, there ought to be a limit to the number and length
of questionnaires to fill out and the number of underlings to
interview before a serious businessman can get to see a responsible
official.</p>

<p>After making three fruitless trips to Washington and getting
exhaustively familiar with countless tantalizing waitingrooms,
I became impatient. The man I needed to see was a Brigadier
General Thario, but after wasting valuable days and hours I
was no nearer reaching him than in the beginning. I had filled
out the necessary forms and stated the nature of my business
so often I began to be alarmed lest my hand refuse to write
anything else and I be condemned for the rest of my life to
repeat the idiotic phrases called for in the blank spaces.</p>

<p>I am afraid I must have raised my voice in expressing my
exasperation to the young lady who acted as receptionist and
barrier. At any rate she looked startled, and I think pressed
a button on her desk. A pinkfaced, whitemustached gentleman
came hastily through the door behind her. The jacket of his
uniform fitted snugly at the waist and his bald head was sunburnt
and shiny.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>"What's this? What's this? ... going on here?"</p>

<p>I saw the single star on his shoulderstraps and ventured,
"General Thario?"</p>

<p>He hid his white mustache with a forefinger pink as his
cheeks. "Yes. Yes. But you must have an appointment to speak
to me. That's the rule, you know. Must have an appointment."
He appeared extremely nervous and harassed, his eyes darting
back to the refuge of his office, but he was evidently held to the
spot by whatever distress animated his receptionist.</p>

<p>"General Thario," I persisted firmly, "I quite appreciate
your viewpoint, but I have been trying for days to get such an
appointment with you on a matter of vital concern and I have
been put off every time by what I can only describe as redtape.
I am sorry to say so, General Thario, but I must repeat, redtape."</p>

<p>He looked more worried than before and his eyes ranged
over the room for some escape. "Know just how you feel," he
muttered, "Know just how you feel. Horrible stuff. Swaddled
in it here. Simply swaddled in it. Strangled." He cleared his
throat as though to disembarrass it of a garrote. "But, uh, hang
it, Mr&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Weener. Albert Weener. President of Consolidated Pemmican
and Allied Concentrates Incorporated."</p>

<p>"&mdash;Well, you know, Mr. Weener ... man your position
... appreciate absolute necessity certain amount of routine
... keep the cranks out, otherwise swarming with
them, simply swarming ... wartime precautions ... must
excuse me now ... terribly rushed ... glad to have met&mdash;"</p>

<p>Swallowing the rest of the sentence and putting his hand
over his mouth lest he should inadvertently regurgitate it, he
started for his office. "General Thario," I pleaded, "a moment.
Consider our positions reversed. I have long since established
my identity, my responsibility. I want nothing for myself; I am
here doing a patriotic duty. Surely enough of the routine you
mention has been complied with to permit me to speak to you
for five or ten minutes. Do for one moment as I say, General,
and put yourself in my place. Think of the discouragement<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
you as a citizen would feel to be hampered, perhaps more than
is necessary."</p>

<p>He took his hand down from his mouth and looked at me
out of blue eyes so pale as to be almost colorless. "But hang it,
you know, Mr Weener ... highly irregular. Sympathize
completely, but consider ... don't like being put in such a
position ... why don't you come back in the morning?"</p>

<p>"General," I urged, flushed with victory, "give me ten minutes
now."</p>

<p>He collapsed. "Know just how you feel ... wanted to be
out in the field myself ... no desk soldier ... lot of nonsense
if you ask me. Come in, come in."</p>

<p>In his office I explained the sort of contract I was anxious
to secure and assured him of my ability to fulfill its terms. But
I could see his mind was not intent upon the specifications for
fieldrations. Looking up occasionally from a dejected study of
his knees, he kept inquiring, in elliptical, practically verbless
questions, how many men my plant employed, whether I had
a satisfactory manager and if a knowledge of chemistry was
essential to the manufacture of concentrates; evading or discussing
in the vaguest terms the actual business in hand.</p>

<p>However, he seemed very friendly and affable toward me
personally once the chill air of the waitingroom had been left
behind and as Button Fles had advised me insistently to entertain
without regard to expense any officials with whom I came
in contact, I thought it politic to invite him to dinner. He
demurred at first, but at length accepted, instructing his secretary
to phone his wife not to expect him home early. I suggested
Mrs Thario join us, but he shook his head, muttering,
"No place for women, Mr Weener, no place for women."
Whether this referred to Washington or the restaurant where
we were going or to his life largely was not clear.</p>

<p>Wartime Washington was in its usual chaotic turmoil and
it was impossible to get a taxi, so we had to walk. But the general
did not seem at all averse to the exercise. It seemed to me
he rather enjoyed returning the salutes with the greatest
punctilio and flourish. On our way we came to one of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
capital's most famous taverns and I thought I detected a hesitancy
in his stride.</p>

<p>Now I am not a drinking man myself. I limit my imbibing
to an occasional glass of beer on account of the yeast it contains,
which I consider beneficial. I hope, however, I am no
prig or puritan and so I asked casually if he would care to stop
in for an appetizer.</p>

<p>"Well, now you mention it, Mr Weener ... hum ...
fact is ... don't mind if I do."</p>

<p>While I confined myself to my medicinal beverage the general
conducted a most remarkable raid on the bar. As I have
hinted, he was in demeanor a mild appearing, if not indeed a
timid man. In the course of an hour's conversation no word of
profanity, such as is affected by many military men, had crossed
his lips. The framed photograph of his wife and daughters on
his desk and his respectful references to women indicated he
was not the type of soldier who lusts for rapine. But seated
before that dull mahogany bar, whatever inhibitions, whatever
conventional shackles, whatever selfdenials and repressions
had been inculcated fell from him swiftly and completely. He
barked his orders at the bartender, who seemed to know him
very well, as though he were addressing a parade formation of
badly disciplined troops.</p>

<p>Not only did General Thario drink enormously, but he
broke all the rules I had ever heard laid down about drinking.
He began with a small, squat glass, which I believe is called an
Oldfashioned glass, containing half cognac and half ryewhisky.
He followed this with a tall tumbler&mdash;"twelve full ounces ...
none of your eightounce thimbles ... not trifled with"&mdash;of
champagne into which the bartender, upon his instructions
and under his critical eye, poured two jiggers of tropical rum.
Then he wiped his lips with a handkerchief pulled from his
sleeve and began with a serious air on a combination of benedictine
and tequila. The more he imbibed, the longer, more
complete and more coherent his sentences became. He dropped
his harassed air; his abdomen receded, his chest expanded,
bringing to my notice for the first time the rows of ribbons<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
which confirmed his earlier assertion that he was not a desk
soldier.</p>

<p>He was sipping cura&ccedil;ao liberally laced with applejack when
he suggested we have our dinner sent in rather than leave
this comfortable spot. "The fact of the matter is, Mr Weener&mdash;I'm
going to call you Albert if you don't mind&mdash;"</p>

<p>I said I didnt mind with all the heartiness at my command.</p>

<p>"The fact of the matter is, Albert, I have devoted my unfortunate
life to two arts: the military and the potatory. As you
may have noticed, most of the miserable creatures on the
wrong side of a bar adopt one of two reprehensible courses:
either they treat drinking as though the aim of blending liquids
were to imitate some French chef's fiddlefaddle&mdash;a dash
of bitters, a squirt of orange, an olive, cherry, or onion
wrenched from its proper place in the saladbowl, a twist of
lemonpeel, sprig of mint or lump of sugar and an eyedropperful
of whisky; or else they embrace the opposite extreme of
vulgarity and gulp whatever rotgut is thrust at them to addle
their undiscerning brains and atrophy their undiscriminating
palates. Either practice is foreign to my nature and philosophy.
I believe the happiest combinations of liquors are simple ones,
containing no more than two ingredients, each of which
should be noble&mdash;that is to say, drinkable in its own right."</p>

<p>He raised his fresh glass, containing brandy and arrack. "No
doubt you have observed a catholicity in my taste; I range
through the whole gamut from usquebaugh to sake, though
during the present conflict for obvious patriotic reasons, I
cross vodka from my list, while as a man born south of the
Mason-Dixon Line, sir, I leave gin to Nigras."</p>

<p>I must say, though somewhat startled by his manner of
imbibing, I was inclined to like General Thario, but I was
impatient to discuss the matter of a contract for Consolidated
Pemmican. Every time I attempted to bring the subject round
to it he waved me grandly aside. "Dinner," he confirmed,
when the waiters brought in their trays. "Yes; no drink is complete
without a little bit of the right food to garnish it. Eating
in moderation I approve of; but mark my words, Albert, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
man who takes a meal on an empty stomach is digging his grave
with his teeth."</p>

<p>If he would not talk business I could only hope his amiability
would carry over till I saw him again in his office tomorrow.
I settled down as far as I could, simply to enjoy his company.
"You may have been surprised at my referring to my life as
unfortunate, Albert, but it is a judicious adjective. Vilely
unfortunate. I come of a military family, you know; you will
find footnotes mentioning the Tharios in the history of every
war this country has had."</p>

<p>He finished what was in his glass. "My misfortunes, like
Tristram Shandy's, began before my birth&mdash;and in the same
way, exactly the same way. My father was a scholar and a gentleman
who dreamed his life away over the campaigns of the
great captains instead of attempting to become a great captain
himself. I do not condemn him for this: the organization of
the army is such as to encourage impracticality and inadvertence,
but the consequences were unfortunate for me. He
named me after his favorite heroes, Stuart Hannibal Ireton
Thario, and so aloof was he from the vulgarities of everyday
life that it was not until my monogram was ordered painted
upon my first piece of luggage that the unfortunate combination
of my initials was noted. Hannibal and Ireton promptly
suppressed in the interests of decency, nevertheless at West
Point my surname was twisted by fellow classmates into Lothario,
giving it a connotation quite foreign to my nature.
I lived down both vexations only to encounter a third. Though
Ireton remained successfully concealed, the Hannibal leaked
out and when, during the World War, I had the misfortune
to lead a company which was decimated"&mdash;his hand strayed to
the ribbons on his chest&mdash;"behind my back the enlistedmen
called me Cannibal Thario."</p>

<p>He began discussing another drink. "Of one thing I'm resolved:
my son shall not suffer as I have suffered. I did not send
him to West Point so he might win decorations on the field of
valor and then be shunted off to sit behind an unsoldierly
desk. I broke with tradition when I kept him from a military<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
career, quite on purpose, just as I was thinking of his welfare
and not some silly foible of my own when I called him by the
simplest name I could find."</p>

<p>"What is your son's name?" I was constrained to ask.</p>

<p>"George," he answered proudly, "George Thario. There is
no nickname for George as far as I know."</p>

<p>"And he's not in the army now?" I queried, more in politeness
than interest.</p>

<p>"No, and I don't intend he shall be." The general's pink
face grew pinker with his vehemence. "Albert, there are plenty
of dunderheads and duffers like me in the country who are
good for nothing better than cannonfodder. Let them go and
be killed. I'm willing enough&mdash;only an idiotic General Staff has
booted me into the Quartermaster Corps for which I am no
more fitted than to run an academy for lady marines&mdash;but I'm
not willing for a fine sensitive boy, a talented musician like
George to suffer the harsh brutalities of a trainingcamp and
battlefield."</p>

<p>"The draft ..." I began tentatively.</p>

<p>"If George had a civilian position in an essential industry&mdash;say
one holding a contract with the army for badly needed
fieldrations...."</p>

<p>"I should like to meet your son," I said. "I have been looking
around for some time for a reliable manager...."</p>

<p>"George might consider it." General Thario squinted his
glass against the light. "I'll have him stop by your hotel tomorrow."</p>

<p>The little radio behind the bar, which had been mumbling
to itself for hours, spoke loudly. "We interrupt this program
to bring you a newsflash: Eire has declared war on the Soviet
Union. I repeat, war has been declared on the Union of Soviet
Republics by Eire. Keep tuned to this station for further
details. We return you now to our regular program."</p>

<p>There was an absent pattering of applause and General
Thario stood up gravely, glass in hand. "Gallant little Eire&mdash;or,
if I may be permitted once the indulgence of using the good
old name we know and love so well&mdash;brave old Ireland. When<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
the world was at war, despite every provocation, she stayed
peaceful. Now that the world is disgracefully pacific&mdash;and you
have all heard foreign ministers unanimously declaring their
countries neutral&mdash;so fast did they rush to the microphones
that they were still panting when they went on the air&mdash;when
the whole world was cautious, Ireland, true to her traditions,
joined the just cause. Gentlemen, I give you our fighting ally,
Eire."</p>

<p>Departing from his usual custom, he drank the toast in one
gulp, but no one else in the room paid any attention. I considered
this lack of enthusiasm for a courageous gesture quite
unworthy and meditated for a moment on the insensitivity
into which our people seemed to have sunk.</p>

<p>As the evening went on, the general grew more and more
affable and, if possible, less and less reticent. He had, he assured
me, been the constant victim, either of men or of circumstances.
At the military academy he had trained for the cavalry
only to find himself assigned to the tank corps. He had reconciled
himself, pursued his duties with zeal, and was shunted
off to the infantry, where, swallowing chagrin, he had led his
men bravely into a crossfire from machineguns. For this he
got innumerable decorations and a transfer to the Quartermaster's
Department. His marriage to the daughter of an influential
politician should have assured peacetime promotion,
but the nuptials coincided with an election depriving the
family's party of power.</p>

<p>Now another war had come and he was a mere brigadier
pigeonholed in an unimportant office with juniors broadly
hinting at his retirement while classmates were leading divisions
and even army corps to glorious victory on the field of
battle. At least, they would have been leading them to glorious
victory if there had been any action at all.</p>

<p>"Invade," insisted General Thario, becoming sufficiently
stirred by his fervor to lapse into sober incoherence. "Invade
them before they invade us. Aircraft out ... gentlemen's
agreement ... quite understand ... well ... landingbarges
... Bering Sea ... strike south ... shuttle transports<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
... drive left wing TransSiberian ... holding operation
by right and center ... abc ..."</p>

<p>No doubt it was a pity he was deprived of the opportunity to
try these tactics. I was one of the few who had not become a
military theoretician upon the outbreak of the war, but to my
lay mind his plan sounded feasible. Nevertheless, I was more
interested in the possible contract for food concentrates than
in any strategy, no matter how brilliant. I'm afraid I showed
my boredom, for the general abruptly declared it was time to
go home.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">41.</span> <span class="num2">I</span> was a little dubious that after all
the drinking and confidences he would remember to send his
son around, and to tell the truth, in the calm morning, I felt
I would not be too sorry if he didnt, for he had not given me a
very high opinion of that young man. What on earth Consolidated
Pemmican could do with a musician and a draftevader
as generalmanager&mdash;even if the title, as it must be, were purely
honorary&mdash;I couldnt imagine.</p>

<p>I had been long up, shaved and breakfasted and had attended
to my correspondence, before the telephone rang and
George Thario announced himself at my disposal.</p>

<p>He was what people call a handsome young man. That is, he
was big and burly and slow and his eyelashes were perceptible.
His hair was short and he wore no hat, but lounged about the
room with his hands, thumbs out, in his jacketpockets, looking
at me vaguely through the curling smoke from a bent pipe.
I had never seen anyone look less like a musician and I began
to wonder if his father had been serious in so describing him.</p>

<p>"I don't like it," he announced abruptly.</p>

<p>"Don't like what, Mr Thario?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"Joe to you," he corrected. "Mister from you to me belies
our prospective relationship. Just call me Joe."</p>

<p>"I thought your name was George."</p>

<p>"Baptismal&mdash;whim of the Old Man's. But it's a stuffy label&mdash;no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
shortening it, you know, so the fellows all call me Joe.
Chummier. Don't like the idea of evading the draft. Shows a
lack of moral courage. By rights I ought to be a conchie, but
that would just about kill the Old Lady. She's in a firstclass
uproar as it is&mdash;like to see me in the frontlines right now,
bursting with dulce et decorum. I don't believe it would bother
the Old Man any if I sat out the duration in a C O camp, but
it'd hurt his job like hell and the poor old boy is straining his
guts to get into the trenches and twirl a theoretical saber. So I
guess I'm slated to be your humble and obedient, Mr Weener."</p>

<p>"I'll be delighted to have you join our firm," I said wryly,
for I felt he would be a completely useless appendage. In this
I am glad to say I did him an injustice, for though he never
denied his essential lack of interest in concentrates and the
whole process of moneymaking, he proved nevertheless&mdash;at
such times as he chose to attend to his duties&mdash;a faithful and
conscientious employee, his only faults being lack of initiative
and a tendency to pamper the workers in the plant.</p>

<p>But I have anticipated; at the moment I looked upon him
only as a liability to be balanced in good time by the asset of
his father's position. It was therefore with irritation I listened
to his insistence on my coming to the Thario home that afternoon
to meet his mother and sisters. I had no desire for purely
social intercourse, last evening's outing being in the nature of
a business investment and it seemed superfluous to be forced
to extend courtesies to an entire family because of involvement
with one member.</p>

<p>However great my reluctance I felt I couldnt afford to risk
giving offense and so at fouroclock promptly I was in Georgetown,
using the knocker of a door looking like all the other
doors on both sides of the street.</p>

<p>"I'm Winifred Thario and youre the chewinggum man&mdash;no,
wait a minute, I'll get it&mdash;the food concentrate man who's
going to make Joe essential to the war effort. Do come in, and
excuse my rudeness. I'm the youngest, you know, except for
Joe, so everybody excuses me." Her straight, blond hair looked
dead. The vivacity which lit her windburned face seemed a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
false vivacity and when she showed her large white teeth I
thought it was with a calculated effort.</p>

<p>She led me into a livingroom peopled like an Earlyvictorian
conversationpiece. Behind a low table, in a rockingchair, sat
a large, fullbosomed woman with the same dead hair and
weatherbeaten cheeks, the only difference being that the
blondness of her hair was mitigated by gray and in her face
were the tiny broken red lines which no doubt in time would
come to Winifred.</p>

<p>"This is Mama," said Winifred, accenting the second syllable
strongly and contriving at once to be vivacious and
reverent.</p>

<p>Mama inclined her head toward me without the faintest
smile, welcoming or otherwise, placing her hand as she did so
regally upon the teacozy, as upon a royal orb.</p>

<p>"Mrs Thario," I said, "I am delighted to meet you."</p>

<p>Mama found this beneath her condescension.</p>

<p>"And this is Constance, the general's firstborn," introduced
Winifred, still retaining her liveliness despite Mama's low
temperature. Constance was the perfect connectinglink between
Winifred and her mother, not yet gray but soon to be so,
without Winifred's animation, but with the same voluntary
smile showing the same white teeth. She rose and shook my
hand as she might have shaken a naughty puppy, with a vigorous
sidewise jerk, disengaging the clasp quickly.</p>

<p>"And this," announced Winifred brightly, "is Pauline."</p>

<p>To say that Pauline Thario was beautiful would be like saying
Mount Everest is high. In her, the blond hair sparkled like
newly threshed straw, the teeth were just as white and even,
but they did not seem too large for her mouth, and her complexion
was faultless as a cosmetic ad. She was an unbelievably
exquisite painting placed in an appropriate frame.</p>

<p>And yet ... and yet the painting had a quality of unreality
about it, as though it were the delineation of a madonna
without child, or of a nun. There was no vigor to her beauty,
no touch of the earthiness or of blemish necessary to make the
loveliness real and bring it home. She did not offer me her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
hand, but bowed in a manner only slightly less distant than
her mother's.</p>

<p>I sat down on the edge of a petitpoint chair, thoroughly illatease.
"You must tell us about your pills, Mr Weener," urged
Winifred.</p>

<p>"Pills?" I asked, at a loss.</p>

<p>"Yes, the thingamyjigs youre going to have Joe make for
you," explained Constance.</p>

<p>Mama made a loud trumpeting noise which so startled me
I half rose from my seat. "Damned slacker!" she exclaimed,
looking fiercely right over my head.</p>

<p>"Now, Mama&mdash;bloodpressure," enjoined Pauline in a colorless
voice.</p>

<p>Mama relapsed into immobility and Winifred went on,
quite as if there had been no explosion. "Are you married,
Mr Weener?"</p>

<p>I said I was not.</p>

<p>"Then here's our chance for Pauline," decided Winifred.
"Mr Weener, how would you like to marry Pauline?"</p>

<p>I could do nothing but smile uncomfortably. Was this the
sort of conversation habitually carried on in their circle or
were they quite mad? Constance mentioned with apparent
irrelevance, "Winifred is so giddy," and Pauline smiled at me
understandingly.</p>

<p>But Winifred went on, "Weve been trying to marry Pauline
off for years, you know. She's wonderful to look at, but she
hasnt any sexappeal."</p>

<p>Mama snorted, "Damned vulgar thing to have."</p>

<p>"Would you like some tea, Mr Weener?" asked Constance.</p>

<p>"Tea! He looks like a secret cocacola guzzler to me! Are
you an American Mr Uh?" Mama demanded fiercely, deigning
for the first time to address me.</p>

<p>"I was born in California, Mrs Thario," I assured her.</p>

<p>"Pity. Pity. Damned shame," she muttered.</p>

<p>I was partially relieved from my uneasiness by the appearance
of George Thario, who bounded in, waved lightly at his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
sisters and kissed his mother just below her hairline. "My
respectful duty, Mama," he greeted.</p>

<p>"Damned hypocrisy. You did your duty youd be in the
army."</p>

<p>"Bloodpressure," warned Constance.</p>

<p>"Have they made you thoroughly miserable, Mr Weener?
Don't mind them&mdash;there's something wrong with all the
Tharios except the Old Man. Blood gone thin from too much
intermarriage."</p>

<p>"Just like incest," exclaimed Winifred. "Don't you think
incest's fascinating, Mr Weener? Eugene O'Neill and all that
sort of thing?"</p>

<p>"Morbid," objected Constance.</p>

<p>"Damned nonsense," grunted Mama.</p>

<p>"Cream or lemon, Mr Weener?" inquired Constance.
Mama, moved by a hospitable reflex, filled a grudging cup.</p>

<p>"Cream, please," I requested.</p>

<p>"Turn it sour," muttered Mama, but she poured the cream
and handed the cup to Constance who passed it to Pauline
who gave it to me with a gracious smile.</p>

<p>"You just mustnt forget to keep Pauline in mind, Mr
Weener; she would be a terrific help when you become horribly
rich and have to do a lot of stuffy entertaining."</p>

<p>"Really, Winifred," protested Constance.</p>

<p>"Help him to the poorhouse and a damned good riddance."</p>

<p>I spent another uneasy fifteen minutes before I could decently
make my departure, wondering whether I hadnt made
a mistake in becoming involved with the Tharios at all. But
there being no question of the solidity of the general's position,
I decided, since it was not afterall incumbent upon me to continue
a social connection with them, to bear with it and confine
my acquaintance as far as possible to Joe and his father.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">42.</span> <span class="num2">A</span>s soon as the contracts were awarded
the struggle began to obtain necessary labor and raw materials.
We were straining everything to do a patriotic service to
the country in time of war, but we came up against the competition
for these essentials by ruthless capitalists who had no
thought but to milk the government by selling them supplies
at an enormous profit. Even with the wholehearted assistance
of General Thario it was an endless and painful task to comply
with, break through, or evade the restrictions and regulations
thrown up by an uncertain and slowmoving administration,
restrictions designed to aid our competitors and hamper
us. Yet we got organized at last and by the time three Russian
marshals had been purged and the American highcommand
had been shaken up several times, we had doubled the capacity
of our plant and were negotiating the purchase of a new
factory in Florida.</p>

<p>I set aside a block of stock for the general, but its transfer
was a delicate matter on account of the indefatigable nosiness
of the government and I approached his son for advice. "Alberich!"
exclaimed Joe incomprehensibly. "Just wrap it up
and mail it to him. Mama, God bless her, takes care of all
financial transactions anyway." And doubtless with great force,
I thought.</p>

<p>Such directness, I pointed out, might have embarrassing
repercussions because of inevitably smallminded interpretation
if the facts ever became public. We finally solved the problem
by putting the gift in George Thario's name, he making
a will leaving it to the general. I informed his father in a
guarded letter of what we had done and he replied at great
length and somewhat indiscreetly, as the following quotation
may show:</p>

<p>"... In spite of pulling every handy and unhandy wire I
am still billeted on this ridiculous desk. The General Staff is
the most incompetent set of blunderers ever to wear military
uniform since Bull Run. They've never heard of Foch, much
less of Falkenhayn and Mackensen, to say nothing of Rommel,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
Guderian or Montgomery. They rest idly behind their Washington
breastworks when the order of the day should be attack,
attack, and again attack; keeping the combat entirely verbal,
weakening the spirit of our forces and waiting supinely for the
enemy to bring the war to us...."</p>

<p>Although I was too much occupied with the press of business
to follow the daytoday progress of hostilities, there was little
doubt the general was justified in his strictures. The war was
entirely static. With fear of raids by marauding aircraft allayed,
the only remaining uneasiness of the public had been
whether the words "heavier than air craft" covered robot or
V bombs. But when weeks had passed without these dreadful
missiles whistling downward, this anxiety also went and the
country settled down to enjoy a wartime prosperity as pleasant,
notwithstanding the fiftyhour week, rationing, and the
exorbitant incometax, as the peacetime panic had been miserable.
In my own case Consolidated Pemmican was quoted
at 38 and I was on my way, in spite of all hampering circumstances,
to reap the benefits of foresight and industry. Unique
among great combats, not a shot had so far been exchanged
and everyone, except cranks, began to look upon the academic
conflict as an unalloyed benefit.</p>

<p>Gradually the war began leaving the frontpages, military
analysts found themselves next to either the chessproblems,
Today's Selected Recipe, or the weekly horoscope; people
once more began to concern themselves with the grass. It now
extended in a vast sweep from a point on the Mexican coast
below the town of Mazatlan, northward along the slope of the
Rocky Mountains up into Canada's Yukon Province. It was
wildest at its point of origin, covering Southern California and
Nevada, Arizona and part of New Mexico, and it was narrowest
in the north where it dabbled with delicate fingers at the
mouth of the Mackenzie River. It had spared practically all of
Alaska, nearly all of British Columbia, most of Washington,
western Oregon and the seacoast of northern California.</p>

<p>Why it surged up to the Rockies and not over them when it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
had conquered individually higher mountains was not understood,
but people were quick once more to take hope and
remember the plant's normal distaste for cold or think there
was perhaps something in the rarefied atmosphere to paralyze
the seeds or inhibit the stolons, so preventing further progress.
Even through the comparatively low passes it came at such a
slow pace methods tried fruitlessly in Los Angeles were successful
in keeping it back. Everyone was quite ready to wipe
off the Far West if the grass were going to spare the rest of
the country.</p>

<p>General Thario's indiscreet letters kept coming. If anything,
they increased in frequency, indiscretion, and length as his
continued frustration in securing a field command was added
to his helpless wrath at the generalstaff's ineptitude. "... They
have got hold of that odd female scientist, Francis," he wrote,
"and have made her turn over her formula for making grass go
crazy. It's to be used as a war weapon, but how or where I don't
know. Just the sort of silly rot a lot of armchair theorists
would dream up...."</p>

<p>Later he wrote indignantly: "... They are sending a group
of picked men to Russia to inoculate the grasses on the steppes
with this Francis stuff. Sheer waste of trained men; bungling
incompetence. Why not send a specially selected group of hypnotists
to persuade the Russians to sue for peace? It would be
better to have given them Mills bombs and let them blow up
the Kremlin. Time and effort and good men thrown away ..."</p>

<p>Still later he wrote with unconcealed satisfaction: "... Well,
that silly business of inoculating the steppes came to exactly
nothing. Our fellows got through of course and did their job,
but nothing happened to the grass. Either Francis gave them
the wrong formula (possibly mislaid the right one in her
handbag) or else what worked in California wouldn't do elsewhere.
She is busy trying to explain herself to a military commission
right now. For my part they can either shoot her or
put her in charge of the WAC. It's of no moment. You can't
fight a determined enemy with sprayguns and formulas. Attack
with infantry by way of Siberia ..."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">43.</span> <span class="num2">W</span>hile everyone, except possibly General
Thario and others in similar position, was enjoying the
new comradeinarms atmosphere the abortive war had brought
on, a sudden series of submarine attacks on the Pacific Fleet
provided a disagreeable jolt and ended the bloodless stage of
the conflict. Tried and proved methods of detection and defense
became useless; the warships were nothing more than
targets for the enemy's torpedoes.</p>

<p>In quick succession the battleships <i>Montana</i>, <i>Louisiana</i>, <i>Ohio</i>,
and <i>New Hampshire</i> were sunk, as were the carriers <i>Gettysburg</i>,
<i>Antietam</i>, <i>Guadalcanal</i>, and <i>Chapultepec</i> as well as the
cruisers <i>Manitowoc</i>, <i>Baton Rouge</i>, <i>Jackson</i>, <i>Yonkers</i>, <i>Long
Beach</i>, <i>Evanston</i> and <i>Portsmouth</i>, to say nothing of the countless
destroyers and other craft. Never had the navy been so
crippled and the people, presaging correctly a forthcoming
invasion, suffered a new series of terrors which was only relieved
by the news of the Russian landings on the California
coast at Cambria, San Simeon and Big Sur.</p>

<p>"... What did I tell you? What did I tell them, the duffers
and dunderheads? We could have been halfway across
Asia by now; instead we waited and hemmed and hawed till
the enemy, from the sheer weight of our inertia, was forced to
attack. The whole crew should be courtmartialed and made
to study the campaigns of Generals Shafter and Wheeler as
punishment." General Thario's always precise handwriting
wavered and trembled with the violence of his disgust.</p>

<p>An impalpable war, pregnant with annihilating scientific
devices and other unseen bogies was one thing; actual invasion
of the sacred soil over which Old Glory flew, and by presumptuous
foreigners who couldnt even speak English, was quite
another. At once the will of the nation stiffened and for the
first time something approaching enthusiasm was manifest.
Cartoonists, moved by a common impulse, unanimously drew
pictures of Uncle Sam rolling up his sleeves and preparing to
give the pesky interlopers a good trouncing before hurling
them back into the Pacific.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>Unfortunately the presence of the grass prevented quick
eviction of the unwelcome visitors. Only a small portion of the
armed forces was based on the Pacific coast, because of the
logistical problems presented by inadequacies of supply and
transportation. Of these only a fraction could be sent to the
threatened places for fear dispersions of the main body would
prove disastrous if the landings were feints. Thus the enemy
came ashore practically unopposed at his original landingpoints
and secured small additional beachheads at Gorda,
Lucia, Morro Bay and Carmel.</p>

<p>East of the grass there were whole armies who had completed
basic training, fit and supple. The obvious answer to the invasion
was to load them on transports and ship them to the theater
of operations. Unfortunately the agreement not to use
heavierthanaircraft was an insuperable bar to this action.</p>

<p>That the pact had never been designed to prevent nations
from defending their soil against an invader was certain; thousands
of voices urged that we keep the spirit of the treaty and
disregard the letter. No one could expect us to sit idly by and
let our homeland be invaded because of overfinicky interpretation
of a diplomatic document.</p>

<p>But in spite of this clear logic, the American people were
swept by a wave of timidity. "If we use airplanes," they argued,
"so will the Russians; airplanes mean bombs; bombs mean
atombombs. Better to let the Russians hold what advantage
their invasion has given them than to have our cities destroyed,
our population wiped out, our descendants&mdash;if any&mdash;born with
six heads or a dozen arms as a result of radioactivity."</p>

<p>According to General Thario, for a while it was touchandgo
whether the President would yield to the men of vision or the
others. But in the end apprehension and calculation ordained
that every effort must be made to reinforce the defense of the
West Coast&mdash;except the effective one.</p>

<p>Of course every dirigible was commandeered and work
speeded up on those under construction; troopships, heedless
of their vulnerability, rushed for the Panama Canal; while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
negotiations were opened with Mexico, looking toward transporting
divisions over its territory to a point south of the weed.</p>

<p>While confusion and defeatism took as heavy a toll of the
country's spirit as an actual defeat on the battlefield, the Russians
slowly pushed their way inland and consolidated their
positions. The American units offered valiant resistance, but
little by little they were driven northward until a fairly fixed
front was established south of San Francisco from the ocean to
the bay and a more fluid one from the bay to the edge of the
grass. Army men, like the public, were suspicious of the enemy's
apparent contentment with this line, for they reasoned
it presaged further landings to the north.</p>

<p>General Thario's jubilation contrasted with the common
gloom. "At last the blunderers have given me active duty. I
have a brigade in the Third Army&mdash;finest of all. Can't write
exactly where I'm stationed, but it is not far from a wellknown
city noted for its altitude, located in a mining state. Brigade is
remarkably fit, considering, and the men are rearing to go.
Keep your ear open for some news&mdash;it won't be long...."</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">44.</span> <span class="num2">T</span>he news was of the heroic counterlandings.
The entire fleet, disdainful of possible submarine
action, stood off from the rear of the Russian positions, bombarding
them for fortyeight hours preliminary to landing
marines who fought their way inland to recapture nearly half
the invaded territory. Simultaneously the army below San
Francisco pushed the Russians back and made contact at some
points with the marines. The enemy was reduced to a mere
foothold.</p>

<p>But the whole operation proved no more than a rearguard
action. As General Thario wrote, "We are fighting on the
wrong continent." Joe was even broader and more emphatic.
"It's a putup job," he complained, "to keep costplus plants
like this operating. If they called off their silly war (Beethoven
down in the cellar during the siege of Vienna expresses the
right attitude) and went home, the country would fall back<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
into depression, we'd have some kind of revolution and everybody'd
be better off."</p>

<p>I had suspected him of being some kind of parlor radical and
although he would doubtless outgrow his youthful notions, it
made me uneasy to have a crank in my employ. But beyond
urging him to keep his ideas strictly to himself and not leave
any more memopads scribbled over with clef signs on his desk,
I could do nothing, for upon his retention depended his
father's goodwill&mdash;the general's assignment to a fieldcommand
hadnt altered the status of our contracts&mdash;and we had too many
unscrupulous competitors to rely solely upon merit for the
continuance of our sales.</p>

<p>George Thario's attitude was symptomatic of the demoralization
of the country, apparent even during our momentary
success. There was no will to victory, and the generalstaff, if
one could believe General Thario, was too unimaginative and
inflexible to meet the peculiar conditions of a war circumscribed
and shaped by the alien glacier dividing the country
and diverting normal operations into novel channels.</p>

<p>So the new landings at Astoria and Longview, though anticipated
and indeed precisely indicated by the flimsiness of the
Russian resistance to the counteroffensive, caught the highcommand
by surprise. "Never was a military operation more
certain," wrote General Thario, "and never was less done to
meet the certainty. Albert, if a businessman conducted himself
like the military college he would be bankrupt in six months."
Wherever the fault lay, the American gains were wiped out
and the invaders swept ahead to occupy all of the country west
of the grass.</p>

<p>Boastfully, they sent us newsreels of their entries into Portland
and Seattle. They established headquarters in San Francisco
and paraded forty abreast down Market Street&mdash;renamed
Krassny Prospekt. The Russians also renamed Montgomery
Street and Van Ness after Mooney and Billings respectively,
but for some reason abandoned these designations almost
immediately.</p>

<p>But for all their celebrations and 101 gun salutes, this was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
as far as they could go; the monstrous growth which had
clogged our defense now sealed the invaders off and held them
in an evershrinking sector. Now came another period of quiescence
in the war, but a period radically different in temper
from the first. There were many, perhaps constituting a majority,
who like George Thario wanted a peace, almost any kind
of peace, to be made. Others attempted to ignore the presence
of a war entirely and to conduct their lives as though it did
not exist. Still others seemed to regard it as some kind of game,
a contest carried on in a bloodless vacuum, and from these to
the newspapers and the Wardepartment came the hundreds of
plans, nearly all of them entirely fantastic, for conquering an
enemy now unassailably entrenched.</p>

<p>But while pessimism and lassitude governed the United
States the intruders were taking energetic measures to increase
their successes. "I have been present at the questioning of two
spies," reported General Thario, "and I want to tell you the
enemy is not going to miss a single opportunity, unlike ourselves.
What they have in mind I cannot guess; they can't fly
over the grass any more than we can as long as they want to
conciliate world opinion and I doubt if they can tunnel under
it, but that they intend to do <i>something</i> is beyond question."</p>

<p>Often the obvious course is the surprising one; since the
Russians couldnt go over or under the grass they decided to
march on top of it. They had heard of our prewar snowshoe
excursions on its surface and so they equipped a vast army with
this clumsy footgear and set it in motion with supplytrains on
wide skis pulled by the men themselves. Russian ingenuity,
boasted the Kremlin, would succeed in conquering the grass
where the decadent imperialists had failed.</p>

<p>"It is unbelievable&mdash;you might even call it absurd, but at
least they are doing something, not sitting twiddling their
thumbs. My men would give six months' pay to be as active
as the enemy. To be sure they are grotesque and inefficient&mdash;so
was the Army of Italy. Imagine sending an army&mdash;or armies
if our reports are correct&mdash;on a six hundred mile march without
an airforce, without artillery, without any mechanized<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
equipment whatsoever. Unless, like the Army of Italy, they
have a Bonaparte concealed behind their lunacy they have no
chance at all of success, but by the military genius of Joseph
Eggleston Johnston, if I were a younger man and not an
American I would like to be with them just for the fun they
are having."</p>

<p>By its very nature the expedition was composed exclusively
of infantry divisions carrying the latest type of automatic rifle.
The field commissaries, the ambulances, the baggagetrains,
had to be cut to the barest minimum and General Thario
wrote that evidently because of the impossibility of taking
along artillery the enemy had also abandoned their light and
heavy machineguns. Against this determined threat, behind
the wall of the Rockies, the American army waited with field
artillery, railway guns, bazookas and flamethrowers. For the
first time there was belief in a Russian defeat if not in eventual
American victory.</p>

<p>But the waiting Americans were not to be given the opportunity
for handtohand combat. Since planes could not report
the progress of the snowshoers over the grass, dirigibles and
free balloons drifting with the wind gave minutetominute reports.
Though many of the airships were shot down and many
more of the balloons blown helplessly out of the area, enough
returned to give a picture of the rapid disintegration of the
invading force.</p>

<p>Nothing like it had happened to an army since 1812. The
snowshoes, adequate enough for short excursions over the edge
of the grass, became suicidal instruments on a march of weeks.
Starting eastward from their bases in northern California, Oregon
and Washington, in military formation, singing triumphantly
in minor keys, the Slavic steamroller had presented an
imposing sight. Americans in the occupied area, seeing column
after column of closely packed soldiers tramping endlessly
up and over the grass, said it reminded them of old prints
of Pickett's charge at Gettysburg.</p>

<p>The first day's march went well enough, though it covered
no more than a few miles. At night they camped upon great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
squares of tarpaulin and in the morning resumed their webfooted
way. But the night had not proved restful, for over the
edges of every tarpaulin the eager grass had thrust impatient
runners and when the time came to decamp more than half the
canvases had been left in possession of the weed. The second
day's progress was slower than the first and it was clear to the
observers the men were tiring unduly. More than one threw
away his rifle to make the marching easier, some freed themselves
of their snowshoes and so after a few yards sank, inextricably
tangled into the grass; others lay down exhausted, to
rise no more. The men in the balloons could see by the way the
feet were raised that the inquisitive stolons were more and
more entangling themselves in the webbing.</p>

<p>Still the Soviet command poured fresh troops onto the grass.
Profiting perhaps by the American example, they transported
new supplies to the army by dirigibles, replacing the lost
tarpaulins and rifles, daringly sending whole divisions of
snowshoers by parachute almost to the eastern edge. This last
experiment proved too reckless, for enough of these adventurers
were located to permit their annihilation by longrange
artillery.</p>

<p>"Their endurance is incredible, magnificent," eulogized
General Thario enthusiastically. "They are contending not
only with the prospect of meeting fresh, unworn troops on our
side, but against a tireless enemy who cannot be awed or hurt
and even more against their own feelings of fear and despair
which must come upon them constantly as they get farther into
this green desert, farther from natural surroundings, deeper
into the silence and mystery of the abnormal barrier they have
undertaken to cross. They are supermen and only supernatural
means will defeat them."</p>

<p>But there was plenty of evidence that the general credited
the foe with a stronger spirit than they possessed. Their spirit
was undoubtedly high, but it could not stand up against the
relentless harassment of the grass. The weary, sodden advance
went on, slower and slower; the toll higher and higher. There
were signs of dissatisfaction, mutiny and madness. Some units<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
turned about to be shot down by those behind, some wandered
off helplessly until lost forever. The dwindling of the great
army accelerated, airborne replacements dependent on such
erratic transport failed to fill the gaps.</p>

<p>The marchers no longer fired at the airships overhead; they
moved their feet slowly, hopelessly, stood stockstill for hours
or faltered aimlessly. Occasional improvised white flags could
be seen, held apathetically up toward the balloonists. Long
after their brave start the crazed and starving survivors began
trickling into the American lines where they surrendered.
They were dull and listless except for one strange manifestation:
they shied away fearfully from every living plant or
growth, but did they see a bare patch of soil, a boulder or
stretch of sand, they clutched, kissed, mumbled and wept over
it in a very frenzy.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">45.</span> <span class="num2">B</span>ut the catastrophic loss of their
great armies was not all the enemy had to endure. As the grass
had stood our ally and swallowed the attackers, helping us in
a negative fashion as it were, it now turned and became a positive
force in our relief. Unnoticed for months, it had crept
northwestward, filching precious mile after mile of the hostile
foothold. Now it spurted ahead as it had sometimes done before,
at a furious pace, to take over the coast as far north as the
Russian River, which now doubled the irony of its name, and
added thousands of square miles to its area at the enemy's
expense. It surged directly westward too, making what was
left of the invader's foothold precarious in the extreme.</p>

<p>The stockmarket boomed and the country went wild with
joy at the news of the Soviet defeats. At the darkest moment we
had been delivered by forces outside ourselves, but still indubitably
American. Hymns of praise were sung to the grass
as the savior of the nation and in a burst of gratitude it was
declared a National Park, forever inviolate. Rationing restrictions
were eased and many industries were sensibly returned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
to private ownership. Good old Uncle Sam was unbeatable
afterall.</p>

<p>But if the Americans were jubilant, the Russians were cast
into deepest gloom. Accustomed to tremendous wartime losses
of manpower, they had at first taken the news stoically, interpreting
it as just another defeat to be later redeemed by pouring
fresh troops and then more fresh troops after those which
had gone down. But when they realized they had lost not divisions
but whole armies, that they had suffered a greater blow
than any in their history, that their reserve power was little
greater than the armies remaining to the Americans, and
finally that the grass, the foe which had dealt all these grievous
blows, was rapidly wiping out what remained of their bridgehead,
they began to murmur against the war itself.</p>

<p>"Under our dear little Uncle Stalin," they said, "this would
never have taken place. Our sons and brothers would not have
been sent to die so far away from Holy Mother Russia. Down
with the enemies of Stalin. Down with the warmongering
bureaucracy."</p>

<p>The Kremlin hastened to assure the population it was carrying
out the wishes of the sainted Stalin. It convinced them of
the purity of its motives by machinegunning all demonstrators
and executing after public trials all Trotskyite-fascist-American
saboteurs and traitors. For some reason these arguments
failed to win over the people and on November 7 a new slogan
was heard, "Long live Stalin and Trotsky," which proved so
popular that in a short time the entire bureaucracy was liquidated,
the Soviet Union declared an unequivocal workers'
state, the army replaced by Redguards, the selling of Soviet
bonds decreed a contravention of socialist economy, wages of
all were equalized, and the word stakhanovism erased from all
Russian dictionaries.</p>

<p>No formal peace was ever made. Neither side had any further
appetite for war and though newspapers like the <i>Daily
Intelligencer</i> continued for months to clamor for the resumption
of hostilities, even to using aircraft now that there was less
danger of reprisal, both countries seemed content to return<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
quietly to the status quo. The only results of the war, aside
from the tremendous losses, was that in America the grass had
been unmolested for a year, and the Soviet Union had a new
constitution. One of the peculiar provisions of this constitution
was that political offenders&mdash;and the definition was now
severely limited, leaving out ninetynine percent of those formerly
jeoparded&mdash;should henceforth expiate their crimes by
spending the term of their sentence gazing at the colossal and
elaborate tomb of Stalin which occupied the center of Red
Square.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">46.</span> <span class="num2">G</span>eneral Stuart Thario, rudely
treated by an ungrateful republic, had the choice of a permanent
colonelcy or retirement. I have always thought it was his
human vanity, making him cling to the title of general, which
caused him to retire. At any rate there was no difficulty in finding
a place for him in our organization, and if his son's salary
and position were reduced in consequence, it was all in the
family, as the saying goes.</p>

<p>One of the happy results of our unique system of free enterprise
was the rewarding of men in exact proportion to their
merits and abilities. The war, bringing disruption and bankruptcy
to so many shiftless and shortsighted people, made of
Consolidated Pemmican one of the country's great concerns.
The organization welcoming General Thario was far different
from the one which had hired his son. I now had fourteen factories,
stretching like a string of lustrous pearls from Quebec
down to Montevideo, and I was negotiating to open new
branches in Europe and the Far East. I had been elected to the
directorship of several important corporations and my material
possessions were enough to constitute a nuisance&mdash;for I have
always remained a simple, literary sort of fellow at heart&mdash;requiring
secretaries and stewards to look after them.</p>

<p>It is a depressing sidelight on human nature that the
achievement of eminence brings with it the malice and spite
of petty minds and no one of prominence can avoid becoming<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
the target of stupid and unscrupulous attack. It would be
pointless now to go into those carping and unjust accusations
directed at me by irresponsible newspaper columnists. Another
man might have ignored these mean assaults, but I am
naturally sensitive, and while it was beneath my dignity to
reply personally I thought it perhaps one of the best investments
I could make to add a newspaper to my other properties.</p>

<p>Now I am certainly not the sort of capitalist portrayed by
cartoonists in the early part of the century who would subvert
the freedom of the press by handpicking an editor and telling
him what to say. I think the proof of this as well as of my broadmindedness
is to be found in the fact that the paper I chose to
buy was the <i>Daily Intelligencer</i> and the editor I retained was
William Rufus Le ffa&ccedil;as&eacute;. The <i>Intelligencer</i> had lost both circulation
and money since it had, so to speak, no home base.
But moved perhaps by sentiment, I was not deterred from
buying it for this reason, and anyway it was purchasable at a
more reasonable figure on this account.</p>

<p>Small circulation or no, it&mdash;or rather Le ffa&ccedil;as&eacute; himself&mdash;still
possessed that intangible thing called prestige and I was satisfied
with my bargain. Le ffa&ccedil;as&eacute; showed no reluctance&mdash;as why
indeed should he?&mdash;to continue as managingeditor and acted
toward me as though there had never been any previous association,
but I did not object to this harmless eccentricity as a
smallerminded person might have.</p>

<p>As publisher I named General Thario. I never knew exactly
what purpose a publisher serves, but it seemed necessary for
every newspaper to have one. Whatever the duties of the office,
it left the general plenty of time to attend to the concerns of
Consolidated Pemmican. I fed the paper judiciously with
money and it was not long before it regained most of the circulation
it had lost.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">47.</span> <span class="num2">T</span>here was no doubt the grass, our
ally to such good purpose in the war, had definitely slowed
down; now it was looked upon as a fixture, a part of the American
heritage, a natural phenomenon which had outlived its
sensational period and come to be taken for granted. Botanists
pointed out that <i>Cynodon dactylon</i>, despite its ability to
sheathe itself against a chill, had never flourished in cold areas
and there was no reason to suppose the inoculated grass, even
with its abnormal metabolism, could withstand climates foreign
to its habit. It was true it had touched, in one place, the
arctic tundra, but it was confidently expected this excursion
would soon cease. The high peaks of the Rockies with the
heavy winter snowdrifts lying between them promised no permanent
hospitality, and what seeds blew through the passes
and lighted on the Great Plains were generally isolated by saltbands,
and since they were confined to comparatively small
clumps they were easily wiped out by salt or fire. To all appearance
the grass was satiated and content to remain crouching
over what it had won.</p>

<p>Only a minority argued that in its new form it might be
infinitely adaptable. Before, when stopped, it had produced
seeds capable of bearing the parent strain. So now, they
argued, it would in time acclimate itself to more rigorous temperatures.
Among these pessimists, Miss Francis, emerging
from welldeserved obscurity, hysterically ranged herself. She
prophesied new sudden and sweeping advances and demanded
money and effort equal to that expended in the late war be
turned to combating the grass. As if taxes were not already
outrageously high.</p>

<p>Those in authority, with a little judicious advice from persons
of standing, quite properly disregarded her querulous
importunities. The whole matter of dealing with the weed
was by now in the hands of a permanent body, the Federal Disruptions
Commission. This group had spent the first six
months of its existence exactly defining and asserting its jurisdiction,
which seemed to spread just as the vegetation calling it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
into being did; and the second six months wrangling with the
Federal Trade Commission over certain "Cease and Desist"
orders issued to firms using allusions to the grass on the labels
of their products, thereby implying they were as vigorous, or
of as wide application, as the representation. The Disruptions
Commission had no objection in principle to this castigation;
they merely thought it should have come from their regulatory
hands.</p>

<p>But with the end of the war a new spirit animated the
honorable members of the commission and as a token of revived
energy they issued a stern directive that no two groups
engaged in antigraminous research were to pool their knowledge;
for competition, the commission argued in the sixtyseven
page order, spurred enthusiasm and the rivalry between
workers would the sooner produce a solution. Having settled
this basically important issue they turned their attention to
investigating the slower progress of the grass to determine
whether it was permanent or temporary and whether its present
sluggishness could be turned to good account. As a sort of
side project&mdash;perhaps to show the wideness of their scope&mdash;they
undertook as well to study the reasons for the failure of the
wartime inoculation of the steppes as contrasted with the original
too successful California one. They planned a compilation
of their findings, tentatively scheduled to cover a hundred
and fortyseven foliovolumes which would remain the
basic work for all approaching the problem of attacking the
grass; and as an important public figure who had some firsthand
knowledge of the subject they requested me to visit, at
my own expense, the newest outposts of the weed and favor
them with my observations. I was not averse to the suggestion,
for the authority of the commission would admit me to areas
closed to ordinary citizens and I was toying with the idea
it might be possible in some way to use the devilgrass as an
ingredient in our food products.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">48.</span> <span class="num2">G</span>eorge Thario having shown in many
ways he was growing stale on the job and in need of a vacation,
I decided to take him with me. Besides, if the thought of using
the weed as a source of cheap rawmaterial came to anything,
the engagement of his interest at an early stage would increase
his usefulness. Before setting out for the field I read reports
of investigators on the spot and was disquieted to note a unanimous
mention of new stirrings on the edges of the green
glacier. I decided to lose no time and we set out at once in my
personal plane for a mountain lodge kindly offered by a business
acquaintance. Here, for the next few weeks, keeping in
touch with my manifold affairs only by telephone, Joe and
I devoted ourselves to observing the grass.</p>

<p>Or rather I did. George Thario's idea of gathering data differed
radically from mine&mdash;I feel safe to say, as well as from
that of almost any other intelligent man. In a way he reminded
me of the cameraman Slafe in his brooding obliviousness to
everything except the grass; but Slafe had been doing a job
for which he was being paid, whereas Joe was only yielding
to his own mood. For hours he lay flat on his belly, staring
through binoculars; at other times he wandered about the
edge, looking at, feeling, and smelling it and once I saw him
bend down and nibble at it like a sheep.</p>

<p>"You know, A W," he observed enthusiastically&mdash;he always
called me "A W" with just enough of a curious intonation to
make it doubtful whether the use of the initials was respectful
or satirical&mdash;"you know, A W, I understand those fellows
who went and chucked themselves into the grass. It's sublime;
it has never happened in nature before. Ive read newspaper
and magazine accounts and either the writers have no eyes or
else they lie for the hell of it. They talk about the 'dirty brown'
of the flowers, but A W, Ive seen the flowers myself and theyre
a vivid glorious purple. Have you noticed the iridescent
sparkle when the wind ripples the blades? All the colors of the
spectrum against the background of that marvelous green."</p>

<p>"There's nothing marvelous about it," I told him a little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
irritably. "It used to be really green, a bright, even color, but
up here where it's high and cold it doesnt look much different
from ordinary devilgrass&mdash;dirty and ugly." I thought his enthusiasm
distinctly out of place in the circumstances.</p>

<p>He did not seem to hear me, but went on dreamily, "And
the sounds it makes! My God, A W, a composer'd give half the
years of his life to reproduce those sounds. High and piercing;
soft and muted; creating tonepoems and &eacute;tudes there in
its lonely grandeur."</p>

<p>I have spoken before of the noise produced by the weed, a
thunderous crackling and snapping attributable to its extraordinary
rate of growth. During its dormancy the sound had
ceased and, in the mountains at least, was replaced by different
notes and combinations of notes as the wind blew through its
culms and scraped the tough stems against each other. Occasionally
these ululations produced reflections extremely pleasing,
more often it hurt the ears with a shrieking discordance;
but even at its best it fell far short, to my mind&mdash;and I suppose
I may say I'm as sensitive to beauty as anybody&mdash;of meriting
Joe's extravagant rhapsodies.</p>

<p>But he was entranced beyond the soberness of commonsense.
He filled notebooks, those thick pulppapered volumes
which children are supposed to use in school but never do,
with his reactions. In idle moments when he was away, I
glanced through them, but for the most part they were incoherent.
Meterless poems, lists of adjectives, strained interpretations
of the actions of the grass, and many musical notations
which seemed to get no farther than a repetitive and
faltering start.</p>

<p>I reproduce a few pages of the less chaotic material for what
it is worth: "The iceage drove the Cromagnon from the caves
which prophesied Cnossus and Pithom and the Temple of
Athena in the Acropolis. This grass, twentiethcentury ice,

<p>"For it is the animals. Cows and pigs, horses, goats, sheep
and rabbits abandoned by the husbandman, startled, puzzled;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
the clock with the broken mainspring running backward. The
small game: deer, antlered, striped, and spotted; wildsheep,
<i>ovis poli</i>, TeddyRooseveltshot and Audubonprinted, mountaingoats
leaping in terror to hazardous safety on babel's top,
upward to the pinpoint where no angels dance. But not alone.</p>

<p>"Meat and meateater, food and feeder, predator and prey;
foxes, lynx, coyotes, wolves, wildcats, mountainlion (the passengerpigeon's
gone, the dung they pecked from herds thick as

<i>night and day we traveled, but the birds overhead gave cover
from the sun and the buffalo before us stretched from the river
to the hills</i>), driven by the ice not ice, but living green, up and
up. Pause here upon this little shelf to nibble bark, to mate
and bear; to snarl and claw and rend and suck hot blood from
moving jugularvein; and then move again upward with docile
hoof or else retreat with lashing tail and snarling fang. Biter
and bitten transfused with fear, the timberline behind, the
snow alone welcoming, ironically the glacier meets another
glacier and only glacier gives refuge to glacier's hunted.</p>

<p>"Here little islands on the peaks. Vegetation's sea is death
creeping upward to end at the beginning. The carnivores,
whippedtailed, seek the top, ambition's pinnacle, surveying
nothing. Tomorrow is for man, the lower mind is reasonable
and ponders food and dung and lust, so obstinate the padclaw
prowls higher till nothing's left but pedestal and would then
wing, but being not yet man can only turn again.</p>

<p>"The ruminants, resigned, nibble at the edges of their
death, converting death to life, chewing, swallowing, digesting,
regurgitating and digesting again inescapable fate. Reluctant
sustenance. Emptybellied, the pointed teeth descend
again to take their food at secondhand, to go back sated, brown
blood upon the snow and bits of hide and hair, gnawedat
bones, while fellows, forgetting fear, remaining stoic, eat,
stamp and stamp without impatience and eat again of that
which has condemned them.</p>

<p>"Learned doctor, your addingmachine gives you the answer:
so many carnivores, so many herbivores, the parallel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
dashes introduce extinction. Confusedly the savor of Abel's
sacrifice was sweet to His nostrils, not Cain's fruits. So is the
mind confounded. Turning and devouring each other over
prostrate antlers the snarlers die, their furry hides bloat and
then collapse on rigid bones to make a place for curious sniffings
and quick retreat in trampled snow. There is no victory
without harshness, no hope in triumph. The placid ruminants
live&mdash;the conquerors have conquered nothing.</p>

<p>"The grass comes to the edge of the snow; they eat and fill
their meager bellies, they chew the cud and mate and calve and
live in wretched unawareness of the heat of glory and death.
So is justice done and mercy and yet not justice and yet not

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">49.</span> <span class="num2">I</span>n all this confused rambling I
thought there might be a curious and interesting little observation
about animal migration&mdash;if one could trust the accuracy
of an imagination more romantic than factual&mdash;and I
reduced it to some kind of coherence and added it not only to
my report for the Federal Disruptions Commission, but for
the dispatches I found time to send in to the <i>Intelligencer</i>.
I hardly suppose it is necessary to mention that by now my
literary talents could no longer be denied or ignored and that
these items were not edited nor garbled but appeared exactly
as I had written them, boxed and doubleleaded on page one.
Though the matter was really trivial and in confessing it I
don't mind admitting all of us are subject to petty vanities
I was gratified to notice too that Le ffa&ccedil;as&eacute; had the discernment
to realize how much the public appreciated my handling
the news about the grass, for he advertised my contributions
lavishly.</p>

<p>In my news stories I could tell no less than the full truth,
which was that the grass, after remaining patriotically dormant
throughout the war except for the spurt northward to destroy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
the remnants of the invading host, had once more set out upon
the march. The loss of color I had pointed out to Joe was less
apparent each day of our stay as the old vividness revived with
its renewed energy and the sweet music which entranced him
gave place to the familiar crackling, growing louder with each
foot it advanced down the slope, culminating every so often in
thunderous explosions.</p>

<p>For down the thousand mile incline of the Mississippibasin
it was pouring with accelerating tempo, engulfing or driving
everything before it. It was the old story of the creeping stolons,
the steppedup tangled mass and the great, towering bulk
behind; the falling forward and then the continued headway.
Once more the eastbound trains and highways clogged with
refugees.</p>

<p>My affairs not permitting a longer stay, I returned to New
York, but I could not pry Joe from his preoccupation. "A W,"
he argued, "I'd be no more use to Consolidated Pemmican
right now than groundglass in a ham sandwich. My backside
might be in a swivelchair, but my soul would be right up here.
It's Whitman translated visibly and tangibly, A W, 'Come
lovely and soothing death, undulate round and round.' Besides,
youve got the Old Man now, he's worth more to you
than I ever will be; he loves business. It's just like the army&mdash;without
a doddering old generalstaff to pull him back every
time he gets enthusiastic."</p>

<p>If anyone else in my organization had talked like this I
would have fired him immediately, but I was sure down underneath
his aesthetic poses and artistic pretensions there was a
foundation of good commonsense inherited from the general.
Give the boy his head, I thought; let him stay here and rhapsodize
till he gets sick of it; he'll come back the better executive
for having got it out of his system. Also, as he himself pointed
out, I had his father to rely on and he was a man to whip up
production if ever there was one.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">50.</span> <span class="num2">T</span>he chief purpose of my visit to the
grass was, at least momentarily, a failure. There was little
point sampling and analyzing the weed for its possible use as
an ingredient in a food concentrate if it were impossible to set
up a permanent place to gather and process it. I won't say I
considered my time wasted, but its employment had not been
profitable.</p>

<p>But even immersed in the everexpanding affairs of Consolidated
Pemmican and Allied Industries, as we now called the
parent company, I could not get away from the grass. Each
hour's eastward thrust was reported in detail by an hysterical
radio and every day the newspapers printed maps showing the
newly overrun territory. Once more the grass was the most
prominent thought in men's minds, not only over the land of
its being, but throughout the world. Scientists of every nationality
studied it at firsthand and only strict laws and rigid
searches by customs inspectors prevented the importation of
specimens for dissection in their own laboratories.</p>

<p>The formula of Miss Francis, now at length revealed in its
entirety, was discussed by everyone. There was hardly a man,
woman or child who did not dream of finding some means to
destroy or halt the grass and thereby make of himself an unparalleled
benefactor. A new crop of suggestions was harvested
by the <i>Intelligencer</i>; in addition to the old they included such
expedients as reinoculating the grass with the Metamorphizer
in the hope either of its cannibalistically feeding upon itself
or becoming so infected with giantism as to blow up and burst&mdash;the
failure of the experiment on the Russian steppes was
ignored or forgotten by these contributors; building barriers
of dryice; and the use of infrared lamps.</p>

<p>One of the proposals which tickled the popular imagination
was a plan for vast areas to be roofed and glassenclosed, giant
greenhouses to offer refuge for mankind in the very teeth of
the grass. Artesian wells could be sunk, it was argued, power
harnessed to the tides of the sea and piped underground, the
populace fed by means of concentrates or hydroponic farming.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
Everyone&mdash;except those in authority, the ones who would
have to approve the expenditure of the vast sums necessary&mdash;thought
there was something in the idea, but nothing was done
about it.</p>

<p>Many, believing physical means could be of little avail, suggested
metaphysical ones, and these were always punctiliously
printed by the <i>Intelligencer</i>. They ranged from disregarding
the existence of the weed and carrying on ordinary life as
though it presented no threat, through Holding the Correct
Thought, praying daily for its miraculous disappearance, preferably
at a simultaneous moment, to reorganizing the spiritual

George Thario would have kept me informed. "Piteous if not
too comprehensive for small emotions," he wrote in a letter
only a little more intelligible than the stuff in his notebooks.
"Yesterday I stopped by a small farm or ranch as local grandiloquence
everseeking purple justification has it here. Submarginal
land the tabulating minds of governmentofficials
(spectacles precise on nosebridge, daily ration of exlax safe
in briefcase) would have labeled it, sitting in expectant unease
on hilltops and the uncomfortable slopes between. Dryfarming;
the place illegally acquired from cattlerange (more proper
and more profitable) by nester grandsire; surviving drought
and duststorm, locust, weevil, and straying herds; feeding
rachitic kids, dull women and helpless men for halfacentury.</p>

<p>"The Farm Resettlement Administration would have
moved them to fatter ground a hundred times, but blindly
obstinate they held to what was theirs and yet not theirs. In
the frontseat the man and wife and what remained of quick
moments of dropjawed ecstasy, in back unwieldly chickencoop,
slats patched with bits of applebox and wire, weathered gray;
astonished cocks crowing out of time and hens heads down.
Hitched behind, the family cow, stiffribbed and emptyuddered.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
The grass, deaf lover, had seized the shack, its fingers
curled the solid door, body pressed forward for joyful rape.
The nesters don't look back but pant ahead; the bumping of
the car accommodates the cow.</p>

<p>"Ive had to leave the lodge of course and spend my nights in
a thin house with a roof shaped like two playingcards, with the
misleading sign, in punishment crippled, half fallen from its
support, 'Tourists Accommodated' (if accommodation be
empty spaces with mottoes and porcelain pisspots then punishment
was unrighteous). I shall move on soon, perhaps for the
worse since there is green now, beneath the blue.</p>

<p>"If I can ever come away I shall, but I'd not miss this gladiator
show, this retiarii swing.</p>

<p>"Give my best to the Old Boy&mdash;tell him I'd write direct, but
family feeling makes it hard. Joe."</p>

<p>I showed the letter to the general, expecting him perhaps to
be annoyed by Joe's instability, but he merely said, "Boy
shouldnt be wasting his talents ... put it in sound ...
orchestrate it."</p>

<p>Just as Joe's enthusiasm covered only one aspect of the grass
so his retreat from lodge to wayside hostel, to city hotel, embraced
only a minute sector of the great advance. Neither
moral nor brute force slowed the weed. It clutched the upper
reaches of the Rio Grande and ran down its course to the Gulf
of Mexico like quicksilver in a broken thermometer. It went
through Colorado, Oklahoma and Kansas; it nibbled at the
forks of the Platte; it left behind the Great Salt Lake like a
chip diamond lost in an enormous setting.</p>

<p>There is no benefit to be derived from looking at the darker
side of things and indeed it is a universal observation that
there is no misfortune without its compensation. The loss of
the great cattlegrazing areas of the West increased the demand
for our concentrated foods by the hundredfold. We paid no
duty on the products shipped in from our South American
factories for they competed only with ourselves and we did the
country the humanitarian service of preventing a famine by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
rushing carload after carload westward, rising above all
thoughts of petty gain by making no increase whatever in our
prices despite the expanding demand.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">52.</span> <span class="num2">A</span>bout this time it became indisputable
that Button Gwynnet Fles was no longer of value to Consolidated
Pemmican. His Yankee shrewdness and caution
which enabled him to run the corporation when it was merely
a name and a quotation on the stockmarket had the limits of
its virtues. He was extraordinarily provincial in outlook and
quite unable to see the concern on a world scale. In view of our
vast expansion such narrowness had become an unbearable
hindrance.</p>

<p>I had permitted him to hold a limited number of shares and
to act nominally as secretary in order to comply with the regulations
of the Security and Exchange Commission, but now it
was expedient to add to our officers directors of other companies
whose fields were complementary to ours. Besides, in
General Thario I had a much abler assistant and so, perhaps
reluctantly because of my oversensitivity, I displaced Fles and
making the general president of the corporation I accepted the
post of chairman of the board.</p>

<p>I must say he took a perfectly natural business move with
unbecoming illgrace. "It was mine, Mr Weener, you know it
was mine and I did not protest when you stole it; I worked
loyally and unselfishly for you. It isnt the money, Mr Weener,
really it isnt&mdash;it's the idea of being thrown out of my own
business. At least let me stay on the Board of Directors; youll
never have any trouble from me, I promise you that."</p>

<p>It distressed me to reject his abject plea, but my hands were
tied by my devotion to the welfare of the company. Besides,
he annoyed me by his palpably untrue reference to what had
been a legitimate transaction, never giving a thought to my
generosity in not exposing his chicanery, nor the fact that the
dummy he manipulated bore no resemblance whatever to the
firm I had brought by my own effort to its present size.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>Leaving matters in the able hands of General Thario, after
warning Joe he had better soon return to his father's assistance,
I went abroad to arrange for wider European representation.
There I found a curious eagerness to be of help to me and
almost fawning servility antipathetic to my democratic American
notions. Oddly enough, the Europeans looked upon the
United States as a doomed country, thinking I, like some members
of our wealthier classes, had come to escape disruption
and dislocation at home. Only in England did I find the belief
prevalent that the Americans would somehow muddle through
because afterall theyre the same sort of chaps we are, you know.</p>

<p>After a highly successful trip I returned home the same day
the Grass reached the headwaters of the Mississippi.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">53.</span> <span class="num2">W</span>illiam Rufus Le ffa&ccedil;as&eacute; astonished
me, as well as every newspaperman in the country by resigning
as editor of the <i>Daily Intelligencer</i>, a post he had held before
many of its reporters were born. When I phoned him to come
to my office and explain himself he refused, in tones and manner
I had not heard from any man since the days when I had
wasted my talents as a subordinate. Having none of the pettiness
of pride which makes some men fearful of their position,
since he would not come to my office, I went to his. There he
shocked me for the third time: a high, glossy collar, a flowing
and figured cravat concealed the famous diamond stud, while
instead of the snuffbox his hands hovered over a package of
cheap cigarettes.</p>

<p>"Weener," he rasped, jettisoning all those courtesies to
which I had become accustomed, "I never thought I'd be glad
to see your vapid face again, unless on a marble slab in some
city morgue, but now youre here, moneybags slapping the insides
of your thighs in place of the scrotum for which you could
have no possible use, I am delighted to tell you in person to
take my paper&mdash;my paper, sir, note that well, for all your dirty
pawings could not make it anything but mine&mdash;and supposit it.
I hope it frets you, Weener, for the sake of your sniveling but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
immortal soul, I sincerely hope it rasps you like a misplaced
hairshirt. You will get some miserable lickspittle to take my
place, some mangy bookkeeping pimp with a permanentwaved
wife and three snottynosed brats, but the spirit and guts
of the <i>Intelligencer</i> depart with W R Le ffa&ccedil;as&eacute;."</p>

<p>I disregarded both his illmanners and his bombast. "What's
the matter, Bill?" I asked kindly, "Is it more money? You can
write your own ticket, you know. Within reason, of course."</p>

<p>His fingers looked for the snuffbox, but found only the cigarettes
which he inspected puzzledly. "Weener, no man could
do you justice. You are the bloody prototype of all the arselickers,
panders, arsonists, kidnapers, cutthroats, pickpockets,
abortionists, pilferers, cheats, forgers, sneakthieves, sharpers
and blackmailers since Jacob swindled his brother. Do not
fawn upon me little man, I am too old to want women or
money. The sands are running out and I shall never now read
the immortable Hobbes, but I'll not die in your bloody harness.
In me you do not see the man who picked up the torch of
Franklin and Greeley and Dana where Henry Watterson
dropped it. Loose of your gangrenous chains, you behold the
freelance correspondent of the North American Newspaper
Alliance, the man who will devote his declining years to reporting
in the terse and vivid prose for which he is justly
famous the progress of the grass which strangles the country
as you have tried to strangle me."</p>

<p>Again I put personal feelings aside. "If your mind is really
made up, we'll want your stuff for the <i>Intelligencer</i>, Bill."</p>

<p>"Sir, you may want. I hope the condition persists."</p>

<p>There being no profit in arguing with a madman, I made
arrangements to replace him immediately. I reproduce here,
not for selfjustification, which would be superfluous, but
merely for what amusement it may afford, one of his accounts
which appeared in the columns of so many third and fourth
rate newspapers. I won't say it shows the decay of a once possibly
great mind, but it certainly reveals that the <i>Intelligencer</i>
suffered no irreparable loss.</p>

<p>"Today at Dubuque, Iowa, the Mississippi was crossed. Not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
by redmen in canoes, nor white on logs or clumsy rafts, nor
yet by multiwheeled locomotives gliding over steel bridges nor
airplanes so high the wide stream was a thread below. Nature
and devastation, hand in hand, for the moment one and the
same, crossed it today as Quantrell or Kirby Smith or Nathan
Bedford Forrest crossed it, sabers glittering, so many forgotten
years ago. But if the men in gray and butternut raided a store
or burned a tavern they thought it a mighty victory and went
home rejoicing; the green invader is an occupier and colonizer,
come to remain for all time, leaving no town, no road, no farm
where it has passed.</p>

<p>"A few weeks ago Dubuque was still here, quiet, old and
pleasant, the butt of affectionate jokes, the Grass still miles
away, the population still hopeful of salvation. And then, because
of the panic, the frantic scurry to save things once valuable
and now only valued, no one noticed when a betraying
wind blew seeds beyond the town, over the river, to find receptive
soil on the Wisconsin side. The seeds germinated, the
clump flourished. It cut the highway and reached down the
banks into the Mississippi, waiting. And while it waited it
built up greater bulk for itself, behind and beside. Each day it
pushed a little farther toward midstream, drowning its own
foremost runners so those behind might have solidity to advance
upon.</p>

<p>"Meanwhile from the west the continent imposed upon a
continent came closer. The other day Dubuque went, its
weathered bricks and immature stucco alike obliterated. The
Grass ran out like a bather on a cold morning, hastening to the
water before timidity halts him. Although I was watching I
could not tell you at what exact instant the gap was closed, at
what moment the runners from one clump intertwined with
those of the other. But such a moment did occur, and shedding
water like a surfacing whale the united bodies rose from the
riverbed to form a verdant bridge.</p>

<p>"You could not walk across it, at least no man I know would
want to try, but it gives the illusion of permanency no work of
man, stone or steel or concrete, has ever given and it is a dismaying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
thing to see man's trade taken over by nature in this
fashion.</p>

<p>"The bridge is a dam also. All the debris from the upper
reaches collects against it and soon there will be floods to add
to the other distress the Grass has brought. More than half
the country is gone now: the territories pillaged from Mexico,
argued from Britain, bought from France, have all been lost.
Only the original states and Florida remain. Shall we be more
successful in defending our basic land than all the acquisitions
of a century and a half?"</p>

<p>But why add any more? Dry, senile, without feeling, my
only wonder was that his stuff was printed, even in the obscure
media where it appeared.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">54.</span> <span class="num2">W</span>ith twothirds of the country absorbed
and a hundred fifty million people squeezed into what
was left, economic conditions became worse than ever. No
European ghetto was as crowded as our cities and no overpopulated
countryside farmed so intensively to so little purpose.
An almost complete cessation of employment except in
the remnant of the export trade, valueless money&mdash;English
shillings and poundnotes illegally circulated being the prized
medium of exchange&mdash;starvation only irritated rather than
relieved by the doles of food seized from the farmers and
grudgingly handed out to the urban dwellers.</p>

<p>Each election saw another party in power, the sole demand
of the voters being for an administration capable of stopping
the Grass. Since none was successful, the dissatisfaction and
anger grew together with the panic and dislocation. Messiahs
and fuehrers sprang up thickly. Riots in all cities were daily
occurrences, rating no more than obscure paragraphs, while
in many areas gangs of hoodlums actually maintained themselves
in power for weeks at a time, ruling their possessions
like feudal baronies and exacting tribute from all travelers
through their domain.</p>

<p>Immigration had long ago been stopped, but now the government,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
in order to preserve what space was left for genuine
Americans, canceled the naturalization of all foreignborn and
ordered them immediately deported. All Jews who had been
in the country less than three generations were shipped to Palestine
and the others deprived of political rights in order to
encourage them to leave also. The Negroes, who except for a
period less than a decade in length had never had any political
or civil rights, planned a mass migration to Africa, a project
enthusiastically spurred by such elder statesmen as the learned
Maybank and the judicious Rankin. This movement proved
abortive when statisticians showed there were not enough
liquid assets among the colored population to pay a profit on
their transportation.</p>

<p>An attempt to oust all Catholics failed also, for the rather
odd reason that many of the minor Protestant sects joined in
a body to oppose it. The Latterday Saints&mdash;now busy building
New Deseret in Central Australia&mdash;and the Church of Christ,
Scientist, as well as the Episcopalians, Doweyites, Shakers,
Christadelphians, and the congregation of the Chapel of the
Former and Latter Rains presented a united front for tolerance
and equity.</p>

<p>An astonishing byproduct of the national despair and turmoil
was the feverish activity in all fields of creative endeavor.
Novels streamed from the presses, volumes of poetry became
substantial items on publishers' lists and those which failed to
find a publisher were mimeographed and peddled to a receptive
public, while painters working with Renascence enthusiasm
turned out great canvases as fast as their brushes could
spread the oils. We had suddenly become a nation madly devoted
to the arts. When Orpheus Crisodd's Devilgrass Symphony
was first played in Carnegie Hall an audience three
times as great as that admitted had to be accommodated outside
with loudspeakers and when the awesome crescendo of
horns, drums, and broken crockery rubbed over slate surfaces
announced the climax of the sixth movement, the crowds
wept. Even for Mozart the hall was full, or practically full.</p>

<p>In the lively arts the impact of the Grass was more overt.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
On the comicpage, Superman daily pushed it back and there
was great regret his activities were limited to a fourcolor process,
while Terry Lee and Flash Gordon, everinspirited by the
sharp outlines of mammaryglands, also saved the country.
Even Lil Abner and Snuffy Smith battled the vegetation while
no one but Jiggs remained absolutely impervious. The <i>Greengrass
Blues</i> was heard on every radio and came from every adolescent's
phonograph until it was succeeded by <i>Itty Bitty Seed
Made Awfoo Nasty Weed</i>.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most notable feature of this period was a preoccupation
with permanency. Jerrybuilding, architectural
mode since the first falsefront was erected over the first smalltown
store, practically disappeared. The skyscrapers were no
longer steel skeletons with thin facings of stone hung upon
them like a slattern's apron, while the practice of daubing mud
on chickenwire hastily laid over paper was discontinued.
Everyone wanted to build for all time, even though the Grass
might seize upon their effort next week. In New York the
Cathedral of St John the Divine was finally completed and a
new one dedicated to St George begun. The demand for
enduring woods replaced the market for green pine and men
planned homes to accommodate their greatgrandchildren and
not to attract prospective buyers before the plaster cracked.</p>

<p>Naturally, forwardlooking men like Stuart Thario and
myself, though we had every respect for culture, were not
swamped by this sudden urge to encourage the effervescent
side of life. Our feet were still upon the ground and though
we knew symphonies and novels and cathedrals had their
place, it was important not to lose sight of fundamentals; while
we approved in principle the desire for permanency, we took
reality into account. We had every faith in the future of the
country, being certain a way would be found before long to
stop the encroachments of the weed; nevertheless, as a proper
precaution&mdash;a safeguarding counterbalance to our own enthusiastic
patriotism&mdash;we invested our surplus funds in Consols
and European bonds, while hastening our plans for new factories
on other continents.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>I'm sure George Thario must have been a great cross to his
father although the general never spoke of him save in the
most affectionate terms. Living like a tramp&mdash;he sent a snapshot
once showing him with a long starveling beard, dressed in
careless overalls, his arm over the shoulder of a slovenly looking
girl&mdash;he stayed always on the edge of the advancing weed,
moving eastward only when forced. He wrote from Galena:</p>

<p>"Eagle forgotten. The rejected accepted, for yesterday's
eagle is today's, the hero is man and man his own hero. I was
with him when he died and when he died again and a hundred
miles to the south is another eagle forgotten and all the prairies,
green once more, will be as they were before men insulted
them. O eagle forgotten. O stained prairie, O gallows, thirsty
mob, knife, torch, revolver. Contumely, parochialism, the
shortvision forever gone; and the long vision too, the eagle
forgotten is the national bird, the great merging with the
greater, so gained too late a vision and saw the hope that was
despair.</p>

<p>"I named the catalogue of states and the great syllables
rolled from my tongue to echo silence. My sister, my bride.
Gone and gone; the Conestoga wagons have no more faint ruts
to follow, the Little Big Horn is a combination of letters, the
marking sunflowers exist no more. We destroyed, we preempted;
we are destroyed and we have been thrust out. Illinois
admitted to the Union on suchandsuch a date, the Little Giant
rubbed stubby fingers through pompous hair heavy with beargrease,
the Honorable Abe in Springfield's most expensive
broadcloth, necktie in the latest mode but pulled aside to free
an eager adamsapple; the drunken tanner, punctual with the
small man's virtues, betrayed and dying painfully with so much
blood upon his hands; and the eagle himself, forgotten and
now again forgotten.</p>

<p>"I move once more. Step by step I give it up, the land we
took and the land we made. Each foot I resign leaves the rest
more precious. O precious land, O dear and fruitful soil. Its
clods are me, I eat them, give them back; the bond is indissoluble.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
Even the land gone is still mine, my bones rest in it,
I have eaten of its fruits and laid my mark on it...."</p>

<p>All of which was a longwinded way of saying the Grass was
overrunning Illinois. In contrast I cannot forbear to quote
Le ffa&ccedil;as&eacute;, though his faults, at the opposite end of the scale,
were just as glaring: "It is in Kentucky now, birthstate of
Abraham Lincoln, sixteenth president of the United States,
a country which once stretched south of the Forty-ninth Parallel
from the Atlantic to the Pacific. I have been traveling
extensively in what is left of Lincoln's nation. 'Dukes,' remarked
Chesterton, 'don't emigrate.' This country was settled
by the poor and thriftless and now few more than the poor and
thriftless remain in it.</p>

<p>"Let me try to present an overall picture: What is left of the
country has become a nineteenth century Ireland, with all
economic power in the hands of absentees. It is not that everyone
below the level of a millionaire is too stupid to foresee
possibility of complete destruction; or the middle and lower
classes virtuously imbued with such fanatical patriotism they
are prepared for mass suicide rather than leave. Because dukes
<i>are</i> emigrating and sending the price of shippingspace into
brackets which make the export of any commodity but diamonds
or their own hides a dubious investment, even the
pawning of all the family assets would not buy steerage passage
for a year old baby. Besides there are not enough bottoms
in the world to transport a hundred and fifty million people.
If the Grass is not stopped, except for a negligible few, it will
cover Americans when it covers America.</p>

<p>"No wonder a strange and conflicting spirit animates our
people. Apathy? Yes, there is apathy; you can see it on the
faces in a line of relief clients wondering how long an industrially
stagnant country can continue their dole&mdash;even though
now it consists of nothing but unpalatable chemicals&mdash;socalled
'Concentrates.' Despair? Certainly. The riots and lootings,
especially the intensified ones recently in Cleveland and Pittsburgh,
are symptoms of it. The overcrowded churches, the terrific<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
increase in drugging and drinking, the sex orgies which
have been taking place practically in the open in Baltimore
and Philadelphia and Boston are stigmata of desperation.</p>

<p>"Hope? I suppose there is hope. Congress sits in uninterrupted
session and senators lend their voices night and day to
the destruction of the Grass. The Federal Disruptions Commission
has published the eleventh volume of its report and is
currently holding hearings to determine how closely the extinct
buffalograss is related to <i>Cynodon dactylon</i>. Every research
laboratory in the country, except those whose staffs and
equipment have been moved with their proprietary industries,
is expending its energies in seeking a salvation.</p>

<p>"Perhaps only in the Deep South, as yet protected by the
width of the lower Mississippi, is there something approaching
a genuine hope, although ironically that may be the product
of ignorance. Here the overlords have gone and the poor
whites, unsupported by an explicit kinship, have withdrawn
into complete listlessness. Some black men have fled, but to
most the Grass is a mere bogey, incapable of frightening those
who have survived so much. Now, for the first time since 1877
the polls are open to all and there are again Negro governors,
and black legislatures. And they are legislating as if forever.
Farm tenancy has been abolished, the great plantations have
been expropriated and made cooperative, the Homestead Act
of 1862 has been applied in the South and every citizen is entitled
to claim a quartersection. There is a great deal of laughter
at this childish lawmaking, but it goes on, changing the face
of the region, the lawmakers themselves not at all averse to the
joke."</p>

<p>Everything Le ffa&ccedil;as&eacute; wrote was not only dull, but biased
and unjust as well. It was true capital was leaving the country
rapidly, but what other course had it? To stay and attempt to
carry on industry in the midst of the demoralization was obviously
impractical. The plants remained and when a way was
found to conquer the Grass we would be glad to reopen them,
for this would be a practical course, just as the flight of capital<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
was a practical course; standards of living were now so reduced
in the United States it would be more profitable to employ
cheap American labor than overpaid Latin or European.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">55.</span> <span class="num2">I</span> had now no fixed abode, dividing my
time between Rio and Buenos Aires, Melbourne and Manchester.
General Thario and his family lived in Copenhagen,
overseeing our continental properties, now of equal importance
with the South American holdings. Before leaving, and
indeed on every trip back home, he visited his son&mdash;no easy
thing to do, what with the young man's constant movement
and the extreme difficulty of going from east to west against
the torrent pouring in the opposite direction. Joe had married
the female of the snapshot, or contracted some sort of permanent
alliance with her&mdash;I never got it quite straight and the
Tharios were deplorably careless about such details; and she
proved as eccentric as he was. No appeal to selfinterest, no
pleading he forgo his morbid preoccupation with the Grass for
the sake of his family, could move them.</p>

<p>"A W&mdash;you have seen it, heard it, smelled it. Can't you
explain&mdash;miraculously touched with the gift of lucidity for
fact as you are for the fictions of production, overhead and
dividends? Oh, not to Mama&mdash;either she understands better
than I or not at all&mdash;but to the Old Man or Connie?</p>

<p>"As a child you learn for the first time of death: the heart is
shuttered in a little cell, too cruel for breathing; the sun is
gray. In an instant you forget; the sky is bright; the blood
pounds. Years later the adolescent falls in love with death;
primps his spirit for it; recalls in unpresumptuous brotherhood
Shelley and Keats and Chatterton. Afterward the flush
fades; we are reconciled to life, but the promise is still implicit.
Now, however, it must be earned, awaited. Haste would destroy
the savor. The award assured, pace becomes dignified.</p>

<p>"But death is not death; life is never mocked. The Grass is
not death any more than it is evil. The Grass is the Grass. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
is me and I am it; 'in my father's house there are many mansions,
if it were not so I would not have told you.'</p>

<p>"No, I suppose not; yet it hurts my liver to offer the old boy
incomprehensible reasons or verbiage like 'compulsion neurosis'
when all he wants is to protect me from my own impulses
as he protected me from the army. Florence and I delight in
him&mdash;he comes again next week if possible&mdash;but we cannot convey
to him the unthinkableness of leaving...."</p>

<p>I heard about this visit later from the general. Joe had
scoured Chicago for the alcoholic commodities now practically
unprocurable, and returned in triumph to the couple's furnished
room. There they entertained him with two bottles of
cointreau and a stone demijohn of cornwhisky. "Touched
... filial affection ... even drank the cointreau&mdash;fiddling
stuff, no wonder it was still available in the drought ... better
son a man never had....</p>

<p>"Girl's all right. Moved in circles ... perhaps not accustomed
... bit rough in speech, but heart of gold ... give
you the shirt right off her back ... hum ... manner of
speaking ... know what I mean...."</p>

<p>But she would not add her persuasions to those of the general.
"Joe's got to stay. It's not something he sat down and
thought up, the way you plan dinner or whether blue goes
good with your new permanent. He's got to stay because he's
got to stay. And of course, so do I. We couldnt be satisfied
anywhere we couldnt see the Grass. Life's too dull away from
it ... but of course that's only part&mdash;it's too big to explain...."</p>

<p>"But George&mdash;Joe as you call him ... highly talented ...
sensitive ... shouldnt be allowed to decay," the general
argued. "Fascination ... understand, but effort of will ...
break the spell. Europe ... birthplace of culture ... reflection
... give him a proper perspective ... chance to
do things...."</p>

<p>Even when the evening lengthened and he became more
lucid under the stimulus of cornwhisky and cointreau he could
not shake them. "Judicious retreat, especially in the face of
overwhelming superiority, has always been a military weapon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
and no captain, no matter how valiant, has ever feared to
use it."</p>

<p>"Pop," George Thario had retorted goodhumoredly, "you
dragged in the metaphor, not I. Youve heard of the Alamo and
Vicksburg and Corregidor? Well, this is them&mdash;all rolled into
one."</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">56.</span> <span class="num2">T</span>he first snows of this ominous winter
halted progress of the Grass. It went sluggish and then
dormant first in the far north, where only the quick growingseason,
once producing cabbages big as hogsheads, had allowed
it to spread at a rate at all comparable to its progress farther
south. But by now there could be no doubt left that <i>Cynodon
dactylon</i>, once so sensitive to cold that it had covered itself,
even in the indistinguishable Southern California winter,
with a protective sheath, had become inured to frost and chill,
hibernating throughout the severest cold and coming back
vigorously in the spring.</p>

<p>It now extended from Alaska to Hudson Bay, covering all
Manitoba and parts of Ontario. It had taken to itself Minnesota,
the northern peninsula of Michigan, Wisconsin, a great
chunk of Illinois, and stood baffled on the western bank of the
Mississippi from Cairo to its mouth. The northwestern, underpopulated
half of Mexico was overrun, the Grass moving but
sluggishly into the estados bordering the Gulf Coast.</p>

<p>I cannot say this delusive safety was enjoyed, for there was
unbelievable hardship. In spite of the great bulk of the country's
coalfields lying east of the Grass and the vast quantities
of oil and natural gas from Texas, there was a fuel famine,
due largely to the breakdown of the transportation system.
People warmed themselves after a fashion by burning furniture
and rubbish in improvised stoves. Of course this put an
additional strain on firedepartments, themselves suffering
from the same lack of new equipment, tires, and gasoline,
afflicting the general public and great conflagrations swept
through Akron, Buffalo and Hartford. Garbage collection systems<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
broke down and no attempt was made to clear the streets
of snow. Broken watermains, gaspipes and sewers were followed
by typhus and typhoid and smallpox, flux, cholera and
bubonic plague. The hundreds of thousands of deaths relieved
only in small degree the overcrowding; for the epidemics displaced
those refugees sheltered in the schoolhouses, long since
closed, when these were made auxiliary to the inadequate hospitals.</p>

<p>The strangely inappropriate flowering of culture, so profuse
the year before, no longer bloomed. A few invincible enthusiasts,
mufflered and raincoated, still bore the icy chill of the
concert hall, a quorum of painters besieged the artist supply
stores for the precious remaining tubes of burntumber and
scarletlake, while it was presumed that in traditionally unheated
garrets orthodox poets nourished their muse on pencil
erasers. But all enthusiasm was individual property, the reaction
of single persons with excess adrenalin. No common
interests united doctor and stockbroker, steelworker and
truckdriver, laborer and laundryman, except common fear of
the Grass, briefly dormant but ever in the background of all
minds. The stream of novels, plays, and poems dried up; publishers,
amazed that what had been profitable the year before
was no longer so, were finally convinced and stopped printing
anything remotely literate; even the newspapers limped along
crippledly, their presses breaking down hourly, their circulation
and coverage alike dubious.</p>

<p>The streets were no more safe at night than in sixteenth
century London. Even in the greatest cities the lighting was
erratic and in the smaller ones it had been abandoned entirely.
Holdups by individuals had been practically given up, perhaps
because of the uncertainty of any footpad getting away
with his loot before being hijacked by another, but small compact
gangs made life and property unsafe at night. Tempers
were extraordinarily short; a surprised housebreaker was
likely to add battery, mayhem and arson to his crimes, and
altercations which commonly would have terminated in nothing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
more violent than lurid epithets now frequently ended in
murder.</p>

<p>Since too many of the homeless took advantage of the law to
commit petty offenses and so secure some kind of shelter for
themselves, all law enforcement below the level of capital
crimes went by default. Prisoners were tried quickly, often in
batches, rarely acquitted; and sentences of death were executed
before nightfall so as to conserve both prison space and rations.</p>

<p>In rural life the descent was neither so fast nor so far. There
was no gasoline to run cars or tractors, but carefully husbanded
storagebatteries still provided enough electricity to catch the
news on the radio or allow the washingmachine to do the
week's laundry. To a great extent the farmer gave up his dependence
on manufactured goods, except when he could barter
his surplus eggs or milk for them, and instead went back
to the practices of his forefather, becoming for all intents and
purposes practically selfsufficient. Soap from woodashes and
leftover kitchen grease might scratch his skin and a jacket of
rabbit or wolverine hide make him selfconscious, but he went
neither cold nor hungry nor dirty while his urban counterpart,
for the most part, did.</p>

<p>One contingency the countrydweller prepared grimly
against: roaming hordes of the hungry from the towns, driven
to plunder by starvation which they were too shiftless to alleviate
by purchasing concentrates, for sale everywhere. Shotguns
were loaded, corncribs made tight, stock zealously
guarded. But except rarely the danger had been overestimated.
The undernourished proletariat lacked the initiative to go
out where the food came from. Generations had conditioned
them to an instinctive belief that bread came from the bakery,
meat from the butcher, butter from the grocer. Driven by desperation
they broke into scantily supplied food depots, but
seldom ventured beyond the familiar pavements. Famine took
its victims in the streets; the farmers continued to eat.</p>

<p>I arrived in New York on the clipper from London in mid-January
of this dreadful winter. I had boarded the plane at
Croydon, only subconsciously aware of the drive from London<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
through the traditionally neat hedgerows, of the completely
placid and lawabiding England around me, the pleasant officials,
the helpful yet not servile porters. Long Island shocked
me by contrast. It had come to its present condition by slow
degrees, but to the returning traveler the collapse was so woefully
abrupt it seemed to have happened overnight.</p>

<p>Tension and hysteria made everyone volatile. The customs
officials, careless of the position of those whom they dealt with,
either inspected every cubic inch of luggage with boorish suspicion
and resultant damage or else waved the proffered handbags
airily aside with false geniality. The highways, repeating
a pattern I had cause to know so well, were nearly impassable
with brokendown cars and other litter. The streets of Queens,
cluttered with wreckage and refuse, were bounded by houses
in a state of apathetic disrepair whose filthy windows refused
to look upon the scene before them. The great bridges over
the East River were not being properly maintained as an occasional
snapped cable, hanging over the water like a drunken
snake, showed; it was dangerous to cross them, but there was
no other way. The ferryboats had long since broken down.</p>

<p>At the door of my hotel, where I had long been accustomed
to just the right degree of courteous attention, a screaming
mob of men and boys wrapped in careless rags to keep out the
cold, their unwashed skins showing where the coverings had
slipped, begged abjectly for the privilege of carrying my bags.
The carpet in the lobby was wrinkled and soiled and in the
great chandeliers half the bulbs were blackened. Though the
building was served by its own powerstation, the elevators no
longer ran, and the hot water was rationed, as in a fifthrate
French pension. The coverlet on the bed was far from fresh,
the window was dusty and there was but one towel in the bathroom.
I was glad I had not brought my man along for him to
sneer silently at an American luxury hotel.</p>

<p>I picked up the telephone, but it was dead. I think nothing
gave me the feeling that civilization as we knew it had ended
so much as the blank silence coming from the dull black earpiece.
This, even more than the automobile, had been the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
symbol of American life and activity, the essential means of
communication which had promoted every business deal, every
social function, every romance; it had been the first palliation
of the sickbed and the last admission of the mourner. Without
telephones we were not even in the horse and buggy days&mdash;we
had returned to the oxcart. I replaced the receiver slowly in its
cradle and looked at it a long minute before going back downstairs.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">57.</span> <span class="num2">I</span> had come home on a quixotic and
more or less unbusinesslike mission. It had long been the belief
of Consolidated Pemmican's chemists that the Grass might
possibly furnish raw material for food concentrates and we
had come to modify our opinion about the necessity for a
processing plant in close proximity. However, at secondhand,
no practicable formula had been evolved. Strict laws against
the transportation of any specimens and even stricter ones
barring them from every foreign country made experiment in
our main research laboratories infeasible; but we still maintained
a skeleton staff in our Jacksonville plant and I had come
to arrange the collection of a large enough sample for them to
get to work in earnest. It was a tricky business and I had no one
beside myself whom I could trust to undertake it except General
Thario, and he was fully occupied.</p>

<p>In addition to being illegal it also promised little profit, for
while dislocation of the normal foodsupply made the United
States our main market for concentrates, American currency
had fallen so low&mdash;the franc stood at $5, the pound sterling at
$250&mdash;it was hardly worthwhile to import our products. Of
course, as a good citizen, I didnt send American money abroad,
content to purchase Rembrandts, Botticellis, Titians or El
Grecos; or when I couldnt find masterpieces holding a stable
price on the world market, to change my dollars into some of
the gold from Fort Knox, now only a useless bulk of heavy
metal.</p>

<p>My first thought was Miss Francis. Though she had more or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
less dropped from public sight, my staff had ascertained she
was living in a small South Carolina town. My telegrams
remaining unanswered, there was nothing for me to do but
undertake a trip there.</p>

<p>Despite strict instructions my planes had not been kept in
proper condition and I had great difficulty getting mechanics
to service them. There were plenty of skilled men unemployed
and though they were not eager to earn dollars they were willing
to work for other rewards. But the pervading atmosphere
of tension and anxiety made concentration difficult; they bungled
out of impatience, committed stupidities they would normally
be incapable of; they quit without cause, flew into rages
at the machines, the tools, their fellows, fate, at or without the
slightest provocation.</p>

<p>My pilot was surly and hilarious by turn and I suspected
him of drinking, which didnt add to my confidence in our
safety. We flew low over railroadtracks stretching an empty
length to the horizon, over smokeless factorychimneys, airports
whose runways were broken and whose landinglights
were dark. The land was green and rich, the industrial life
imposed upon it till yesterday had vanished, leaving behind it
the bleaching skeleton of its being.</p>

<p>The field upon which we came down seemed in slightly
better repair than others we had sighted. The only other ship
was an antique biplane which deserved housing in a museum.
As I looked around the deserted landingstrip a tall Negro
emerged leisurely from one of the buildings and walked toward
us.</p>

<p>"Where are the airport officials?" I asked rather sharply, for
I didnt relish being greeted by a janitor.</p>

<p>"I am the chief dispatcher. In fact, I am the entire personnel
at the moment."</p>

<p>My pilot, standing behind me, broke in. "Boy, where're the
white folks around here?"</p>

<p>The chief dispatcher looked at him steadily a long moment
before answering. "I imagine you will find people of various
shades all over town, including those allegedly white. Was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
there anyone in particular you were interested in or are you
solely concerned with pigmentation?"</p>

<p>"Why, you goddam&mdash;"</p>

<p>I thought it advisable to prevent a possible altercation. I
recalled Le ffa&ccedil;as&eacute;'s articles on the Black South which I had
considered vastly overdrawn. Evidently they were not, for the
chocolatecolored man spoke with all the ease and assurance of
unquestioned authority. "I want to get to a Miss Francis at&mdash;"
I consulted my notes and gave him the address. "Can you get
me a taxi or car?"</p>

<p>He smiled gravely. "We are without such luxuries at present,
I regret to say. But there will be a bus along in about
twenty minutes."</p>

<p>It had been a long time since I suffered the wasted time and
inconvenience of public transportation. However, there was
no help for it and I resigned myself philosophically. I walked
with the chief dispatcher into the airport waitingroom, dull
with the listless air, not of unoccupancy, but disuse.</p>

<p>"Not much air travel," I remarked idly.</p>

<p>"Yours is the first plane in a month."</p>

<p>"I wonder you bother to keep the airport open at all."</p>

<p>"We do what we can to preserve the forms of civilization.
The substance, unfortunately, cannot be affected by transportation,
production, distribution, education or any other such
niceties."</p>

<p>I smiled inwardly. What children these black people were,
afterall. I was relieved from further ramblings by the arrival
of the bus which was as laughable as the chief dispatcher's
philosophizing. The dented and rusty vehicle had been disencumbered
of its motor and was hitched to four mules who
seemed less than enthusiastic over their lot. I got in and seated
myself gingerly on one of the dilapidated seats, noting that the
warning signs "For White" and "For Colored" had been
smeared over with just enough paint to make the intent of
obliteration clear without actually doing so.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">58.</span> <span class="num2">H</span>ow Miss Francis contrived to make
every place she lived in, apartment, chickenhouse or cottage,
look exactly alike was remarkable. Nothing is more absurd
than the notion that socalled intellectual workers are always
alert&mdash;as Miss Francis demonstrated by her greeting to me.</p>

<p>"Well, Weener, what is it this time? Selling on commission
or an interview?"</p>

<p>It was inconceivable any literate person in the United States
could be ignorant of my position. "It is neither," I returned
with some dignity. "I am here to do you a favor. To help you
in your work." And I explained my proposition.</p>

<p>She squatted back on her heels and gave me that old, familiar,
searching look. "So you have made a good thing out
of the Metamorphizer afterall," she said irrelevantly and untruthfully.
"Weener, you are a consistent character&mdash;a beautifully
consistent character."</p>

<p>"Please come to the point, Miss Francis. I am a busy man
and I have come down here simply to see you. Will you accept?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"No?"</p>

<p>"I doubt if I could combine my research with your attempt
to process the inoculated <i>Cynodon dactylon</i>. However, that
would not prevent me from taking you up and using you in
order to further a good cause. But I am not yet ready&mdash;I shall
not be ready for some time, to go directly to the Grass. That
must come later. No, Weener."</p>

<p>I was exasperated at the softness of my impulse which had
made me seek out this madwoman to do her a favor. I could
not regret my charitable nature, but I mentally resolved to be
more discriminating in future. Besides, the thought of Miss
Francis for the work had been sheer sentimentality, the sort of
false reasoning which would make of every mother an obstetrician
or every hen an oologist.</p>

<p>As I sauntered through the drowsy streets, killing time till
the driver of the ridiculous "bus" should decide to guide his
mules back to the airport, I was struck by the lack of tension,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
of apprehension and anxiety, so apparent in New York. Evidently
the Black South suffered little from the brooding fear
and terror; I put it down to their childish thoughtlessness.</p>

<p>Walking thus reflectively, head down, I looked up suddenly&mdash;straight
into the face of the Strange Lady I had driven from
Los Angeles to Yuma.</p>

<p>I'm sure I opened my mouth, but no words came out. She
was hurrying rapidly along, paying no attention either to me
or to her surroundings, aloof and exquisite. I think I put out
my hand, or made some other reflexive gesture to stop her, but
either she failed to notice or misunderstood. When I finally
recovered myself and set out after her, she had vanished.</p>

<p>I waited for the bus, wondering if I had been victim of an
hallucination....</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">59.</span> <span class="num2">I</span>n spite of Miss Francis' blindness to
her own interest I still had a prospective superintendent for
the gathering and shipping of the grass: George Thario. Unless
his obsession had sent him down into Mississippi or Louisiana,
I expected to find him in Indianapolis.</p>

<p>The short journey west was tedious and uncomfortable,
repeating the pattern of the one southward. At the end of it
there was no garrulous chief dispatcher, for the airport was
completely deserted, and I was thankful for an ample stock of
gas for the return flight.</p>

<p>I had no difficulty locating Joe in an immense, highceilinged
furnishedroom in one of the ugliest gray weatherboarded
houses, of which the city, never celebrated for its architecture,
could boast. The first thing to impress me was the room's
warmth. For the first time since landing I did not shiver. A
woodfire burned in an open grate and a kerosene heater
smelled obstinately in an opposite corner. A grandpiano stood
in front of the long narrow windows and on it slouched several
thick piles of curlyedged paper.</p>

<p>He greeted me with something resembling affection. "The
tycoon himself! Workers of the world&mdash;resume your chains.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
A W, it's a pleasure to see you. And looking so smooth and
ordinary and unharassed too, at the moment everyone else is
tearing himself with panic or anguish. How do you do it?"</p>

<p>"I look on the bright side of things, Joe," I answered.
"Worry never helped anybody accomplish anything&mdash;and it
takes fewer muscles to smile than to frown."</p>

<p>"You hear that, Florence?"</p>

<p>I had not noticed her when I came in, the original of the
snapshot, sitting placidly in a corner darning socks. I must say
the photograph had done her less than justice, for though she
was undoubtedly commonlooking and sloppy, with heavy
breasts and coarse red cheeks and unconcealedly dyed hair,
there was yet about her an air of great vitality, kindness, and
good nature. Parenthetically she acknowledged my presence
with a pleasant smile.</p>

<p>"You hear that? Remind me the next time I am troubled
by a transposition or a solopassage that it takes less muscles to
smile than to frown. For I have got to work at last, A W; the
loafing and inviting of my soul is past, my soul has responded
to my invitation. You remember Crisodd's Devilgrass Symphony?
A horrible misconception if ever there was one, a
personal insult to anyone who ever saw the Grass; a dull, unintentional
joke; bad Schoenberg&mdash;if that isnt a tautology&mdash;combined
with faint memories of the most vulgar Wagner&mdash;if that
isnt another tautology&mdash;threaded together on <i>Mighty Like a
Rose</i> and <i>Alexander's Ragtime Band</i>. But what am I saying,
A W, to you who are so free from the virus of culture? What
the hell interest have you in Crisodd's symphony or my symphony
or anybody's symphony, except the polyphony of
profits?"</p>

<p>"I hope no one thinks I'm a narrowminded man, Joe," I
reproved him. "I venture to say I have as much interest in Art
as the next person. Ive done a bit of writing myself, you know,
and literature&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh sure. I didnt mean to hurt your feelings."</p>

<p>"You did not. But while I believe Music is a fine thing in its
place, I came to discuss a different subject."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>"If you mean taking Joe back to Europe with you, youre
out of luck, Mr Weener," put in Florence placidly. "He's
almost finished the first movement and we'll never leave the
Grass till it's all done."</p>

<p>"You mistake me, Mrs Thario. I have a proposition for your
husband, but far from taking him away from the Grass, it
will bring him closer to it."</p>

<p>"Impossible," exclaimed Joe. "I am the Grass and the Grass
is me; in mystical union we have become a single entity. I
speak with its voice and in the great cadences which come from
its heart you can hear Thario's first, transfigured and magnified
a hundred thousand times."</p>

<p>I was sorry to note his speech, always so simple and unaffected
in contrast to his letters, was infected with an unbecoming
pomposity. Looking at him closely I saw he had lost
weight. His flesh had shrunk closer to his big frame and the
lines of his skull stood out sharply in his cheek and jaw. There
was the faintest touch of gray in his hair and his fingers played
nervously with the ragged and illadvised beard on his chin.
He hardly looked the man who had evaded serious work in
order to encourage a silly obsession, comfortably supported
all the while by a sizable remittance from his father.</p>

<p>I outlined to them my plans for gathering samples of the
weed. Florence tucked her stillthreaded needle between her
teeth and inspected the current pair of socks critically. Joe
walked over to the piano and struck several discordant notes.</p>

<p>"I understand there are several parties making expeditions
onto the Grass," I said.</p>

<p>"Lots," confirmed Joe. "There's a group sent out by Brother
Paul on some very mysterious mission. It's called the Sanctification
of the Forerunner. God knows how many thousands
he's made his suckers cough up, for theyre equipped with all
the latest gadgets for polar exploration, skis and dogsleds,
moompitcher cameras, radios and unheardof quantities of
your very best pemmican. They started as soon as the snow was
thick enough to bear their weight and if we have an untimely
thaw theyll go to join the Russians.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then there's the government bunch, the Disruptions
Commission having finally and reluctantly produced an idea,
but exactly what it is they havent confided to an eager citizenry.
Smaller groups too: scientists and nearscientists, enthusiasts
who have got the notion somehow that animals or migratory
game are roaming the snow on top of the grass&mdash;exactly
how they got there is not explained&mdash;planning to photograph,
hunt or trap; and just plain folk making the trip for the hell
of it. We might have gone ourselves if it hadnt been for the
symphony."</p>

<p>"Your symphony is concerned with the Grass?" I asked
politely.</p>

<p>"It's concerned with combinations of sound." He looked at
me sharply and banged out harsher discords. "With life, if
you want to talk like a programnote."</p>

<p>"If you go on this expedition it will give you an opportunity
to gather new material," I pointed out.</p>

<p>"If I look out the window or consult my navel or 'meditate
while at stool' or cut my finger I will get new material with
much less hardship. The last thing a composer or writer or
painter needs is material; it is from excess of material he is the
besotted creature he is. He may lack leisure or energy or ability
or an active colon, but no masterpiece ever was or conceivably
could be thwarted from lack of material."</p>

<p>"Yet you have tied yourself to the Grass."</p>

<p>"Not to prostitute it to whatever talents I have, but because
it is the most magnificent thing on earth."</p>

<p>"Then of course youll go," I said.</p>

<p>"Why don't you go yourself, A W? Do you good to live out
in the open."</p>

<p>"I can't afford the time, Joe; I have too many things that
need my personal attention."</p>

<p>He struck a series of great thumping notes. "And so have I,
A W, so have I. I'm afraid youll have to get somebody else."</p>

<p>I could neither understand nor shake his obstinacy and
when I left them I had almost determined to abandon the
whole project, for I could not think whom else trustworthy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
I could get. His idea of my own participation was fantastic; I
had long since come to the point where it was necessary to delegate
all such duties to subordinates.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">60.</span> <span class="num2">P</span>erhaps it was Joe's sly remark about
it doing me good to be out in the open, or the difficulty of
getting a conveyance, but I decided to walk to my hotel. Taxis
of course disappeared with gasoline, but ingenious men, unwilling
to be pauperized by accepting the dole, had devised
rickshaws and bicycle carriages which were the only means of
local transportation. The night was clear and cold, the stars
gleaming in distant purity, but all around, the offensive smell
of the disheveled city played on my disgusted nostrils.</p>

<p>"In the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. Brother, are you
saved?"</p>

<p>When the figure had come out from the shadow of a building
to accost me my first thought had been of a holdup, but the
odd salutation made this seem unlikely. "What do you want?"
I asked.</p>

<p>"Brother, are you a Christian man?"</p>

<p>I resented the impertinence and started to walk on; he followed
close beside me. "Harden not your heart, miserable
sinner, but let Jesus dissolve your pride as he washes away
your other sins. Be not high and mighty for the high shall be
low and the mighty powerless; in a short time you will be food
for grass. The Grass is food for the Ox, the divine Ox with
seven horns which shall come upon the world with a great
trumpeting and bellowing soon after the Forerunner."</p>

<p>I knew of the great multiplication of insanity and hoped I
could reach the hotel before he grew violent. "What is your
name?" I temporized.</p>

<p>"Call me Brother Paul, for I was once Saul the worldly; now
I am your brother in Christ."</p>

<p>"Brother Paul! The radio preacher?"</p>

<p>"We are all members one of another and He who watches
the sparrow fall makes no distinction between one manmade<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
label and another. All of us who have found Christ Jesus with
the help of Brother Paul are called Brother Paul. Come to the
Loving Arms, O miserable sinner, and be Brother Paul also."</p>

<p>I thought it might be very confusing. "I have always been
interested in religion."</p>

<p>"O puny man. Interested in life and interested in death,
interested in being and interested in begetting, interested in
religion and interested in dung. Turn from those interests
which the devil pays upon your soul's mortgage; your Savior
resides in the heart of the Grass&mdash;withhold not your precious
soul from Him. At this very moment the Forerunner is being
sanctified and after her there will come the Ox to eat the Grass
and then the end of the world. Give Brother Paul your worthless
earthly possessions, give your soul to Jesus and hasten that
glorious day. Hallelujah!"</p>

<p>The fervid jumble ended in a near scream. What a waste of
oratorical and perhaps organizational energy, I mused as I
strode along rapidly, still intent on escaping the fanatic. Under
different circumstances, I thought, a man like this might turn
out to be a capable clerk or minor executive. Suddenly I had
a hunch.</p>

<p>"Mr&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Brother Paul. I have no earthly name."</p>

<p>"I wish youd come with me for a few minutes; I have a proposition
which might interest you."</p>

<p>In the darkness I could see him peering at me suspiciously.
"Is this some worldly seduction from the Christian path?"</p>

<p>"I think you will find what I have to offer a material aid to
your church."</p>

<p>"I have no church," he said. "We are Christians and recognize
no manmade institution."</p>

<p>"Well, then, to your movement or whatever you call it." In
spite of his reluctance, which was now as great as mine had
been originally, I persuaded him to accompany me. He sat
uneasily forward while I told him who I was and sketched the
plan for collecting some of the Grass.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>"What is this to me? I have long ago put aside all material
thoughts and now care only for the life of the spirit."</p>

<p>This must be true, I thought, noting his shabby clothes,
sweatgreasy muffler at once hiding and revealing lack of necktie,
and cracked shoes, one sock brown, the other black. "It is
this to you: if you don't want the salary and bonus attached to
organizing and superintending the expedition&mdash;and I am prepared
to be generous&mdash;you can turn it over to Brother Paul.
I imagine it will be acceptable."</p>

<p>He shook his head, muttering, "Satan, Satan." The lower
part of his face was wide and divided horizontally, like an inverted
jellymold. It tapered up into bracketing ears, supporting
gingery eaves. I pressed home my arguments.</p>

<p>"I will put your proposition to Brother Paul," he conceded
at length.</p>

<p>"I thought distinctions between one man and another were
worldly and trivial," I prodded him. "Arent you Brother
Paul?"</p>

<p>"Satan, Satan," he repeated.</p>

<p>I'm sure it could have been nothing but one of those flashes
of intuition for which successful executives are noted which
caused me to pick this man in spite of his absurd ranting and
illfavored appearance. Not intuition really, but an ability to
evaluate and classify personalities instantly. I always had this
faculty; it helped me in my early experiences as a salesman
and blossomed out when I entered my proper field.</p>

<p>Anthony Preblesham&mdash;for that was his worldly name&mdash;did
not disappoint my judgment for he proved one of the most
aggressive men I ever hired. The Brother Paul hocuspocus,
which he quickly dropped, had merely caught and canalized
an abounding energy that would otherwise have flowed aimlessly
in a stagnant world. In Consolidated Pemmican he found
his true faith; his zeal for our products proved as great if not
greater than his former hysteria for the salvation of mankind.
It was no fault of his that the expedition he led proved fruitless.</p>

<p>The men Tony Preblesham took with him were all Brother<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
Pauls who&mdash;since they disdained them&mdash;had not been told of
material rewards but given the impression they were furthering
their fanatical creed. They built a camp upon the Grass,
or rather upon the snow which overlay the Grass, near what
had once been Springfield, Illinois. Digging down through the
snow to the weed, they discovered it to have lost most of its
rubbery qualities of resistance in dormancy, and cut with comparative
ease more than four tons which were transported with
the greatest difficulty to the Florida plant. Here, to anticipate,
their work came to nothing, for no practicable method was
found for reducing the grass to a form in which its nutritive
elements could be economically extracted.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">61.</span> <span class="num2">T</span>he secrecy surrounding the government
expedition could not be maintained and it was soon
learned that what was planned was nothing less than an attempt
to burn great areas of the weed while in its dormant
state. All previous attempts to fire the Grass had been made
when the sap was running and it was thought that in its dryer
condition some measure of success might be obtained. The
public instantly translated possibility into probability and
probability into virtual certainty, their enthusiastic optimism
making the winter more bearable.</p>

<p>The party proceeded not more than a couple of miles beyond
the eastern edge, dragging with them a flexible pipeline
through which was pumped fueloil, now priceless in the freezing
cities. Methodically they sprayed a square mile and set it
afire, feeding the flames with the oil. The burning area sank
neatly through the snow, exposing the grass beneath: dry, yellow
and brittle. The stiff, interwoven stolons caught; oil was
applied unstintedly; the crackling and roaring and snapping
could be heard by those well beyond the perimeter of the Grass
and the terrific heat forced the temporary abandonment of the
work.</p>

<p>The spotbroadcasters in emotional voices gave the news to
those whose radios still functioned. Reporters flashed their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
editors, BURNING SUCCESSFUL. WILL STOP GRASS
IF MULTIPLIED. All over the country volunteer crews were
instantly formed to repeat the experiment.</p>

<p>When the flames died down the men crept closer to inspect
the results. The heat had melted the snow for many yards outside
the orbit of fire, revealing a border of dull and sodden
grass. Beyond this border a blackened crater had eaten its way
straight down to the reclaimed earth below. Shouting and
rejoicing greeted this evidence of triumph. What if the Grass
could advance at will in summer? It could be subdued in winter
and thus kept in check till the ingenuity which devised this
one victory could win another.</p>

<p>Working furiously, the oil was again sprayed, this time over
a still larger piece and again the flames lit the sky. The President
issued a Proclamation of Thanksgiving; the American
dollar rose to $175 to the pound, and several prominent expatriates
began to think seriously of returning home.</p>

<p>The second fire burned through the night and aided by a
slight change in the weather thawed the snow over a great
area. Eagerly the expedition, now swollen into a small army,
returned to continue their triumphant labors. The bright sun
shone upon the dirtied snow, upon naked muddy earth in the
center of the crater, upon the network of burnt and blackened
stems and upon the wide band of grayishgreen grass the retreating
snow had laid open to its rays. Grayishgreen, but
changing in color at every moment as the work of spraying
began again.</p>

<p>Changing color, becoming more verdant, thrusting blades
into the air, moving its long runners upward and sideways and
downward toward the destroyed part. Revived by the heat,
relieved of the snow, the Grass, fighting for its life with the
same intensity which animated its attackers, burst into a fury
of growth. It covered the evidences of destruction in less time
than the burning had taken. It tore the pipeline from its tormentors'
hands and drove them away with threats of swift
immolation. Defiantly it rose to a pinnacle, hiding its mutilation,
and flaunted its vivid tendrils to bear witness to its invulnerability<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
till a killing frost followed by another snowfall
covered it again.</p>

<p>Since the delusive hope had been so high, the disappointment
threw the public into a despair greater than ever before.
The nervous tension of anxiety was replaced by a listlessness
of resignation and the suicide rate, high before, now doubled.
For the first time a general admission was to be heard that no
solution would be found and in another season the end would
come for the United States. Facing the prospect squarely, an
exodus of the little people, as distinguished from the earlier
flight of men of wealth and foresight, from the country began.</p>

<p>This was the first countermeasure attempted since the Grass
crossed the Mississippi, and in reaction to its collapse, the
return of Brother Paul's expedition passed almost unnoticed.
Only <i>Time</i>, now published in Paris, bothered to report it for
general circulation: "Last week from some undisclosed spot
in mid U.S. returned Mother, 'The Forerunner' Joan (real
name: unknown), and party. Dispatched Grassward by Brother
Paul, doom-predicting, advent-prophesying graminophile
evangelist, the purpose of Mother Joan's expedition had been
her 'Sanctification,' above the exact spot where the Savior was
waiting in the midst of the Grass to receive His faithful disciples.
Said Brother Paul to reporters after embracing The
Forerunner enthusiastically, 'The expedition has been successful.'
Said Mother Joan, off the record, 'My feet hurt.'"</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">62.</span> <span class="num2">T</span>he coming of spring was awaited
with grim foreboding, but the Grass was not bound by any
manmade almanac and unable to contain itself till the melting
of the snow, again leaped the barrier of the Mississippi, this
time near Natchez, and ran through the South like water from
a sloshed dishpan. The prized reforms of the black legislatures
were wiped out more quickly even than their greatgrandfathers'
had been in 1877. The wornout cotton and tobacco
lands offered hospitable soil while cypress swamps and winter-swollen
creeks pumped vitality into the questing runners.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
Southward and eastward it spread, waiting only the opening of
the first pussywillow and the showing of the first crocus to
jump northward and meet the western advance there.</p>

<p>The dwindling remnants of cohesion and selfcontrol existing
before now disappeared completely. The capital was
moved to Portland, Maine. Local law and order vanished. The
great gangs took over the cities and extracted what tribute
they could from the impoverished inhabitants. Utilities ceased
functioning entirely, what little goods remained were obtainable
only by barter, and epidemic after epidemic decreased the
population to fit the shrinking boundaries.</p>

<p>Brother Paul, deprived of the radio, now multiplied himself
infinitely in the person of his disciples, preaching unremittingly
against resistance, even by thought, to the oncoming
Grass. Mother Joan's infrequent public appearances attracted
enormous crowds as she proclaimed, "O be joyful; give your
souls to Jesus and your bodies to the Grass. I am The Forerunner
and after me will come the Ox. Rejoice, brothers and
sisters, for this is the end of all your suffering and misery."</p>

<p>On foot or rarely with the aid of a horse or mule, the panicstricken
population marched northward and eastward. Canadian
officials, anxious to apply immigration controls with the
greatest possible latitude, were thrust aside as though their
existence were an irrelevance. Along the lower reaches of the
St Lawrence the refugees came like locusts to devour the substance
of the <i>habitants</i>. Into empty Ungava and almost equally
empty Labrador the hardier ones pushed, armed like their
forebears with only ax and shotgun. Northward and eastward,
beyond the Arctic Circle and onto the polar ice they trickled,
seeking some place which promised security from the Grass.
Passenger rates to Europe or South America, formerly at a
premium, now shot to unparalleled heights.</p>

<p>I wound up my own affairs, disappointed at the failure to
find a use for the Grass, but still keeping it in view as a future
objective, and arranged for the removal of the Florida factory
to Brazzaville. Heeding the cabled importunities of Stuart
Thario I risked my life to travel once more into the interior to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
see Joe and persuade him to come back with me. I found them
in a small Pennsylvania town in the Alleghenies, once a company
owned miningvillage. The Grass, advancing rapidly, was
just beyond the nearest mountainridge, replacing the jagged
Appalachian horizon with a softer and more ominous one.</p>

<p>They appeared serene and content, Joe's haggard look of
the winter erased. "I'm in the middle of the third movement,
A W," he told me, like a man who had no time to waste on
preliminaries or indirections. "Here." He thrust an enormous
manila envelope at me. "Here are the first two movements.
There are no copies and I cannot trust the mails or any other
messenger to get them out. If possible I'll send the Old Man
the third movement as soon as it's finished&mdash;and the fourth, if
I have time. But take the first two anyway; at least I'll know
theyre preserved."</p>

<p>"Joe, Florence!" I exclaimed. "This is ridiculous. Insane.
Come back with me."</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>"You can compose just as well in Europe, if it is so important
to you. In France, say, or England, away from this danger
and discomfort. There is no doubt the country is finished;
come to safety while you can."</p>

<p>Florence was busy with a stack of musicpaper and offered no
comment. Joe put his hand for a second on my shoulder and
then turned away, talking with his eyes fixed out the window
in the direction of the Grass.</p>

<p>"General Herkimer had both legs shot off at the battle of
Oriskany. He made his men put his back to a treestump and
with a flintlock rifle fired at the enemy until he bled to death.
Commodore Lawrence, mortally wounded, had only one
order. Schoolbooks hold the words of John Paul, selfnamed
Jones, and of Hiram Ulysses Grant. Even yesterday, the old
tradition was alive: 'Enemy landing; issue in doubt.' If I
finish my symphony&mdash;"</p>

<p>"When you finish your symphony&mdash;" I encouraged.</p>

<p>"If you finish your symphony&mdash;" said Florence quietly.</p>

<p>"If I finish my symphony, it must be in Maine, New Hampshire,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
Vermont." His speech took on a hushed, abstracted tone.
"Massachusetts, Rhode Island or Connecticut. New York,
New Jersey, Pennsylvania&mdash;" his voice rose higher&mdash; "Maryland,
Virginia or West Virginia&mdash;" his shoulders shook and he
seemed to be crying&mdash; "North Carolina, South Carolina,
Georgia, Florida ..."</p>

<p>I left them, convinced the madness of the country had found
still another victim. That night I thankfully boarded the
European Clipper for the last time. The next day I sank back
into civilization as into a comfortable bed.</p>

which in its course gathered to itself such an accreta

theoreticians, idealists, revolutionaries, soldiers of fortune
and restless men, that at the height of their numbers they composed,
with their sympathizers, perhaps a third of the people

had all the breaks, including that of a halfhearted enemy, they
established 'upon this continent a new nation.' Some of the

a curious story, for whose authenticity I cannot vouch.</p>

<p>True to the flippant prediction of Jacson Gootes, Le ffa&ccedil;as&eacute;
returned to the Church into which he had been born. He went
further and became a lay brother, taking upon himself the
obligation of silence. Though an old man, he stayed close to
the advancing Grass, giving what assistance and comfort he
could to the refugees. The anecdotes of his sudden appearance
in typhusridden camps, mute and gaunt, hastening with water
for the feverish, quieting the terrified with a light touch, praying
silently beside the dying, sound improbable to me, but I
mention them for what they are worth.</p>

that was left of the largest landmass within the British Commonwealth
was eastern and northern Quebec, the Maritime
Provinces and part of the Northwest Territories.</p>

<p>The United States and more than half of Mexico had been
wiped from the map. From the Pacific to the Atlantic, from
Nome to Veracruz stretched a new Sargasso Sea of <i>Cynodon
dactylon</i>. A hundred and eighty million men, women, and
children had been thrust from their homes by a despised weed.</p>

<p>I cannot say life on the other continents&mdash;and I could call
any of them, except possibly Africa, my home&mdash;was undisturbed
by the disappearance of the United States. American
competition gone, the tempo of businesslife seemed to run
slower and slower. Production dwindled, prices rose; luxury
articles were made in abundance, but manufacturers hesitated
to adopt American methods of massproduction for
necessities.</p>

<p>Russia, after her new revolution, was a quiet backwater economically,
although politically she caused turmoil by giving
a home to the Fourth International. Germany became the
leading iron and steel country, but it was not an aggressive
leadership, rather it was a lackadaisical acceptance of a fortuitous
role; while Britain, often on deathbed but never a corpse,
without question took the lead in international affairs.</p>

<p>Consolidated Pemmican and Allied Industries was now, if
not the largest, certainly one of the largest companies in the
world. We purchased sheep in Australia, beef and wheat and
corn in South America, rice and millet and eggs in Asia, fruit
and sugar and milo in Africa, and what the farmers of Europe
could spare, to process and ship back in palatable, concentrated
form to a world which now constituted our market.
Besides all this we had of course our auxiliary concerns, many
of which dominated their respective fields. Ministers of finance
consulted me before proposing new budgets and there was not
a statesman&mdash;outside the Socialist Union&mdash;who didnt listen
respectfully to my suggestions.</p>

<p>Tony Preblesham had proved an invaluable find. Never the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
type to whom authority in the largest matters could be delegated,
nevertheless he was extremely handy as troubleshooter,
exploiter of new territory or negotiator with competitors or
troublesome laborleaders. The pioneers who had fled to the
north had little to offer in payment for the vast quantities of
food concentrates they required, but the land was rich in furs,
timber, and other resources. With permission of the Danish
authorities I sent Preblesham to Julianthaab. There he established
our headquarters for Greenland, Iceland, and all that
was left of North America. From Julianthaab immediately
radiated a network of posts where our products were traded for
whatever the refugees could bring in.</p>

<p>But the Americans who had gone into the icy wastes were
not seeking subsistence. They were striving mightily to reach
some place of sanctuary where they could no longer be menaced
by the Grass. Beyond the Arctic Circle? Here they might
learn to imitate the Innuit, living on fish and seals and an occasional
obligingly beached whale. But could they be sure, on
territory contiguous or very nearly contiguous to that supporting
the weed, that they could count on immunity? They did
not believe so. They filled up Newfoundland in the hope that
the narrow Gulf of St Lawrence and the narrower Straits of
Belle Isle might offer protective barriers. They crossed on sleds
to Baffin Island and in homemade boats to Greenland. Before
the Grass had wiped out their families, and their less hardy
compatriots left behind in Nova Scotia and Prince Edward
Island, these pioneers abandoned the continent of their origin;
the only effect of their passage having been to exterminate the
last of the Innuit by the propagation of the manifold diseases
they had brought with them.</p>

<p>In the south the tempo was slower, the striving for escape
less hysterical and more philosophic. When the Mexican peon
heard the Grass was in the next village he packed his few belongings
and moved farther away. From Tampico to Chiapas
the nation journeyed easily south, not regretting too loudly
the lands left behind, not crowding or jostling rudely on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
highways, not failing to pause for siestas when the sun was hot,
but traveling steadily in a quiet resignation that seemed beyond
resignation&mdash;the extension of a gracious will.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">66.</span> <span class="num2">B</span>ut the rest of the world, even in
the lethargy which had come upon it in viewing the loss of
most of North America, could not afford to leave the Grass to
its own devices, content to receive the refugees it drove out or
watch them die. A World Congress to Combat the Grass was
hastily called in London. It was a distinguished body of representatives
from all the nations and resembled at its best the
now functionless Federal Disruptions Committee.</p>

<p>At the opening sitting a delegation with credentials from
the President of the United States attempted to join in the
proceedings. One of the French members rose to inquire of
the chairman, Where was the United States? He, the delegate,
had read of such a country, had heard it spoken of&mdash;and none
too favorably&mdash;but did it exist, <i>de facto</i>?</p>

<p>The delegate from Haiti asked for the floor and wished to
assure his distinguished colleague from the motherland of
culture&mdash;especially did he wish to assure this learned gentleman,
bound as they were by the same beautiful and meticulous
language&mdash;that his country had good reason to know the
United States actually existed&mdash;or had done so at one time.
His glorious land bore scars inflicted by the barbarians. His
own grandfather, a great patriot, had been hunted down by
the United States Marines as a bandit. He implored a congress
with humanitarian designs to refuse admission to the delegates
of the socalled United States.</p>

<p>One of the German delegates, after wiping the perspiration
from the three folds on the back of his neck, said he spoke with
great diffidence for fear of being misunderstood. The formerly
existent country had twice defeated, or apparently defeated,
his own in a war and his distinguished colleagues might misinterpret
the spirit which moved him. Nevertheless, he could
not refrain from remarking that it appeared to him that a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
Just Providence had wiped out the United States and therefore
it would be illogical if not blasphemous for this august body
to admit a delegation from a nonexistent country.</p>

<p>The American delegation attempted to point out feebly
that Hawaii still remained and Puerto Rico and Guam. The
members from the various sections of the British Commonwealth,
arguing the precedents of the governmentsinexile,
urged the acceptance of their credentials. The representative
of Switzerland called for a vote and the credentials were
rejected.</p>

<p>This controversy being settled, the body, in high good
humor, selected a governing committee to take whatever measures
it deemed necessary to protect the rest of the world from
the menace. After lengthy debate and much conflicting testimony
from experts a bold plan was endorsed. It was decided
to complete the digging of the Nicaragua Canal and blow up
that part of Central America lying between it and the Isthmus
of Panama. It was a colossal feat of engineering which would
cost billions of pounds and untold manpower, but the nations
of the world, not without some grumbling, finally agreed to
the expenditure.</p>

<p>While technicians from all over the world directed laborgangs
and steamshovels, ammunitionships loaded with tons of
explosives sailed from every port for Panama and Colon.
Though at first reluctant with their contributions, the countries
had reconsidered and poured forth their shares without
stint. All obsolete warmaterials were shipped to the scene of
action. Prisons were emptied to supply the needed manpower
and when this measure fell short all without visible means of
support were added to the roll.</p>

<p>Shortsightedly Costa Rica protested vigorously the proposed
destruction of its entire territory and there were even
momentary uprisings of patriots who proposed to defend their
nation with the last drop of blood, but commonsense and international
amity prevailed, especially when Costa Ricans
were promised a territory twice as big as their native country<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
in the hinterland between Colombia and Venezuela, a valueless
tract both nations had been trying in vain to settle for
decades.</p>

<p>Night and day the detonations of highexplosives killed fish
on both the Atlantic and Pacific sides of Central America and
brought stunned birds plummeting down from the skies to
their death. The coastal plains fell into the sea, great mountains
were reduced to powder and little by little the gap between
North and South America widened.</p>

<p>But the progress of the work was infinitesimal compared
with the advance of the Grass. It swept over the ancient Aztec
empire down to the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. The ruins of
Mayan civilization, excavated once, were buried anew. The
demolition engineers measured their daily progress in feet,
the Grass in miles. When the waters of the Atlantic and Pacific
met in Lake Nicaragua, the Grass was in Yucatan. When the
first green runners invaded Guatemala, a bare twenty miles of
northern Panama had been demolished and hardly a start had
been made in the destruction of Costa Rica.</p>

<p>Fleets of airplanes bombed the connecting strip in the area
left by engineers to the last, but as their flights went on the
Grass crept into British Honduras. The workers sent another
twenty miles of Panama into nothingness and the Grass completed
the conquest of Guatemala. They blew up another ten
miles and the Grass took over El Salvador. Dynamite widened
the Nicaragua Canal to a ridiculously thin barrier as the Grass
overran Honduras.</p>

<p>They stood now almost facetoface, the width of one pitiful
little Banana Republic between them. On one hand the Grass,
funneled and constricted to a strip of land absurdly inadequate
to support its gargantuan might, on the other the combined
resources of man, desperately determined to destroy the
bridge before the invader. In tropic heat the work was kept up
at superhuman pace. Gangs of native laborers fainting under
their loads were blown skyhigh by impatient technicians unwilling
to waste the time necessary to revive them. In selfdefense<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
the South American states doubled their contributions.
At the edge of the weed all the offensive weapons of the
world were massed to stay it as long as possible, for even a
day's&mdash;even an hour's delay might be invaluable.</p>

<p>But the Grass overbore the heavy artillery, the flamethrowers,
the bombs, the radium, and all the devices in its path. The
inventions of war whose constant improvement was the pride
of the human race offered no more obstacle to the Grass than
a few anthills might to a herd of stampeding elephants. It
swept down to the edge of the ditch and paused at the fiftymile
stretch of saltwater between it and the shapeless island still
offering the temptation of a foothold in front of the now vastly
enlarged Panama Canal.</p>

<p>If those engaged in the task, from coordinator-in-chief
down to the sweating waterboys, had worked like madmen
before, they worked like triple madmen now, for the wind
might blow a single seed onto what had been Costa Rica and
undo all they had so far accomplished. The explosions were
continuous, rocking the diminishing territory with ceaseless
earthquakes. After an hour on the job men reeled away, deafened,
blinded and shocked.</p>

<p>On the South American side, as had been planned, great
supercyclone fans were set up to blow back any errant seed.
Fed by vast hydroelectric plants in the Colombian highlands,
the noise of their revolving blades drowned out the sounds of
the explosions for all those nearby. The oceans became interested
participants and enormously high tides possibly caused
by the difference in level between the Atlantic and Pacific,
clawed away great hunks of land. The great island became a
small island, the small island an islet. At last nothing but ruffling
blue water lay between the Grass and South America.
Over this stretch of sea the great fans blew their steady breath,
protecting the continent behind from the fate of its northern
twin.</p>

<p>The passage between was forbidden to all ships for fear they
might inadvertently act as carriers of the seed. The lost continent
was not only isolated, it was sealed off. From the sharp<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
apex of the inverted triangle to its broad base in the arctic ice
the Grass flourished in one undisputed prairie, the sole legatee
of all the hopes, trials, afflictions, dreams and victories of
the men and women who had lived there since the first alien
foot was set upon its soil.</p>

<h3>The South Pacific Sailing Directory</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">67.</span> <span class="num2">I</span> cannot say the world greeted the
end of the North American continent with either rejoicing or
regret. Relief, yes. When the news of the last demolition was
given and it was clear the Grass was unable to bridge the gap,
the imaginative could almost hear mankind emit a vast sigh.
The world was saved, they could go about their business now,
having written off a sixth of themselves.</p>

<p>I was reminded of Miss Francis' remark that if you cut off
a man's leg you bestow upon him a crippled mentality. For
approximately two centuries the United States had been a leg
of the global body, a limb so constantly inflicted with growingpains
it caused the other parts to writhe in sympathy. Now the
member was cut off and everyone thought that with the troublesome
appendage gone life would be pleasanter and simpler.
Debtor nations expanded their chests when they remembered
Uncle Shylock was no more. Industrial countries looked eagerly
to enlarge their markets in those places where Americans formerly
sold goods. Small states whose inhabitants were occasionally
addicted to carrying off tourists and holding them for
ransom now felt they could dispense with those foreign undersecretaries
whose sole business it had been to write diplomatic
notes of apology.</p>

<p>But it was a crippled world and the lost leg still twitched
spectrally. I don't think I speak now as a native of the United
States, for with my international interests I believe I have
become completely a cosmopolitan, but for everyone, Englishman,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
Italian, Afrikander or citizen of Liberia. The disappearance
of America created a revolution in their lives, a change
perhaps not immediately apparent, but eventually to be recognized
by all.</p>

<p>It was the trivial things we Americans had taken for granted
as part of our daily lives and taught the rest of the world to
appreciate which were most quickly missed. The substitution
of English, Turkish, Egyptian or Russian cigarettes for good
old Camels or Luckies; the impossibility of buying a bottle of
cocacola at any price; the disappearance of the solacing wad of
chewinggum; the pulsing downbeat of a hot band&mdash;these were
the first things whose loss was noticed.</p>

<p>For a long time I had been too busy to attend movingpictures,
except rarely, but a man&mdash;especially a man with much
on his mind&mdash;needs relaxation and I would not choose the
foreign movies with their morbid emphasis on problems and
crime and sex in preference to the cleancut American product
which always satisfied the nobler feelings by showing the reward
of the honest, the downfall of evildoers and the purity of
love and motherhood. Art is all very well, but need it be sordid?</p>

<p>As I told George Thario, I am no philistine; I think the
Parthenon and the Taj Mahal are lovely buildings, but I would
not care to have an office in either of them&mdash;give me Radio
City. I don't mind the highbrow programs the British Broadcasting
Corporation put on; I myself am quite capable of
understanding and enjoying them, but I imagine there are
thousands of housewives who would prefer a good serial to
bring romance into their lives. I don't object to a commercial
world in which competitors go through the formality of pretending
to be scrupulously fair in talking about each others'
products, but I must admit I missed the good old American
slapdash advertising which yelled, Buy my deodorant or youll
stink; wash your mouth with my antiseptic or youll lose your
job; brush your teeth with my dentifrice or no one will kiss
you; powder your face with my leadarsenate or youll keep
your maidenhead. I would give a lot of money to hear a

of Times Square urge me to buy something for which I have
no possible use. Living within your income is fine, but the
world lacks the goods youd have bought on the installmentplan;
getting what you need is sound policy, but how many
lives were lightened by the young men working their way
through college, or the fullerbrushman?</p>

<p>I think there was a subconscious realization of this which
came gradually to the top. In the beginning the almost universal
opinion was that the loss of the aching limb was for the
better. I have heard socalled cultured foreigners discuss the
matter in my presence, doubtless unaware I was an American.
No more tourists, they gloated, to stand with their backs to the
Temple of Heaven in Pekin and explain the superior construction
of the Masonic Hall at Cedar Rapids; no more visitors
to the champagne caves at Rheims to inquire where they
could get a shot of real bourbon; no more music lovers at Salzburg
or Glyndebourne to regret audibly the lack of a peppy
swingtune; no more gourmets in Vienna demanding thick
steaks, rare and smothered in onions.</p>

<p>But this period of smug selfcongratulation was soon succeeded
by a strange nostalgia which took the form of romanticizing
the lost land. American books were reprinted in vast
quantities in the Englishspeaking nations and translated anew
in other countries. American movies were revived and imitated.
Fashionable speech was powdered with what were conceived
to be Yankee expressions and a southern drawl was
assiduously cultivated.</p>

<p>Bestselling historical novels were laid in the United States
and popular operas were written about Daniel Boone, Davy
Crockett, and Kit Carson. Men told their growing sons to work
hard, for now there was left no land of opportunity to which
they could emigrate, no country where they could become rich
overnight with little effort. Instead of fairytales children demanded
stories of fortyniners and the Wedding of the Rails;
and on the streets of Bombay and Cairo urchins, probably
quite unaware of the memorial gesture, could be heard whistling
<i>Casey Jones</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>But handinhand with this newfound romantic love went a
completely practical attitude toward those Americans still existing
in the flesh. The earliest expatriates, being generally
men of substance, were well received. The thousands who had
crossed by small boats from Canada to Greenland and from
Greenland to Iceland to Europe were by definition in a different
category and found the quota system their fathers and
grandfathers had devised used to deny their own entrance.</p>

<p>They were as bewildered and hurt as children that any nation
could be at once so shortsighted and so heartless as to bar
homeless wanderers. We bring you knowledge and skills and
our own need, they said in effect, we will be an asset to your
country if you admit us. The Americans could not understand;
they themselves had been fair to all and only kept out undesirable
immigrants.</p>

<p>Gradually the world geared itself to a slower tempo. The
gogetter followed the brontosaurus to extinction, and we
Americans with the foresight to carry on our businesses from
new bases profited by the unAmerican backwardness of our
competitors. At this time I daresay I was among the hundred
most important figures of the world. In the marketing and
packaging of our original products I had been forced to acquire
papermills and large interests in aluminum and steel;
from there the progression to tinmines and rollingmills, to
coalfields and railroads, to shippinglines and machineshops
was not far. Consolidated Pemmican, once the center of my
business existence, was now but a minor point on its periphery.
I expanded horizontally and vertically, delighted to show my
competitors that Americans, even when deprived of America,
were not robbed of the traditional American enterprise.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">68.</span> <span class="num2">I</span>t was at this time, many months
after we had given up all hope of hearing from Joe again, that
General Thario received a longdelayed package from his son.
It contained the third movement of the symphony and a covering
letter:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dear Father&mdash;Stuart Thario&mdash;General&mdash; I shall not finish
this letter tonight; it will be sent with as much of the First
Symphony as makes a worthy essence when it goes. The whole
is greater than the sum of its parts, but there is a place (perhaps
not in life, but somewhere) for the imperfect, for the
incomplete. The great and small alike achieve fulfillment, satisfaction&mdash;must
this be a ruthless denial of all between?</p>

<p>"I have always despised musicologists, makers of programnotes,
little men who tell you the opening chords of Opus 67
describe Fate Knocking at the Door or the call of the yellowhammer.
A child draws a picture and writes on it, 'This is a
donkey,' and when grown proves it to be a selfportrait by translating
the Jupiter Symphony into words. Having said this,
let me stultify myself&mdash;but for private ears alone&mdash;as a bit of
personal history, not an explanation to be appended to the
score.</p>

<p>"I started out to express in terms of strings and winds the
emotions roused in me by the sight and thoughts of the Grass,
much as LvB took a mistaken idealization of his youth as a
startingpoint for Opus 55; but just as no man is an island, so
no theme stands alone. There is a cord binding the lesser to the
greater; a mystic union between all things. The Grass is not
an entity, but an aspect. I thought I was writing about my
country, conceived of myself in a reversed snobbishness, a
haughty humility, a proud abasement, as a sort of superior
Smetana. (Did you know that as a boy I dreamed of the day
when I should receive my commission as second lieutenant?)</p>

<p class="author">Boston, Massachusetts</p>

<p>"I interrupted this letter to sketch some of the middle section
of the fourth movement and I have wasted a precious
week following a false trail. And of course the thought persists
that it may not have been a false trail at all, but the right one;
the business of saying something is a perpetual wrestle with
doubts.</p>

<p>"We leave here tomorrow for an unknown destination&mdash;Portsmouth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
probably and then somewhere in Maine, hoping
to wrench from fate the time to finish the score. It seems more
than a little pompous to continue my explanation. The Grass,
the United States, humanity, God&mdash;whatever we write about
we write about the same things.</p>

<p>"Still there is a limit to individual perception and it seems
to me my concern&mdash;at least my musical concern&mdash;is enclosed
by Canada and Mexico, the Pacific and Atlantic. So, rightly or
wrongly, even if the miracle occur and I do finish in time, I
cannot leave. A short distance, such a short distance from
where I scribble these words, Vanzetti died. No more childish
thought than atonement was ever conceived. It is a base and
baseless gratification. Evil is not recalled. So I do not sentence
myself for the murder of Vanzetti or for my manifold crimes;
who am I to pass judgment, even on me? But all of us, accusers
and accused, condemners and condemned, will remain&mdash;forever
indistinguishable. If the requiem for our faults and our
virtues, if the celebration of our past and the prayer for our
resurrection can be orchestrated, then the fourth movement
will be finished. If not&mdash;</p>

<p class="author">Aroostook, Maine</p>

<p>"By the best calculations we have about three more days.
I do not think the symphony can be finished, but the thought
no longer disturbs me. It would be a good thing to complete it,
just as it would be a good thing to sit on fleecy clouds and
enjoy eternal, nevermelting, nevercloying icecreamcones,
celestially flavored.</p>

<p>"The man who is to carry this letter waits impatiently. I
must finish quickly before his conviction of my insanity outweighs
the promises I have made of reward from you and
causes him to run from me. My love to Mama, the siblings and
yourself and kindly regards to the great magnate.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">69.</span> <span class="num2">A</span>bout the same time I also received
a letter which somehow got through the protective screening
of my secretaries:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Albert Weener,<br />
Savoy Hotel,<br />
Thames Embankment, WC1.</p>

<p class="nmp">"Sir:<br />
You may recall making an offer I considered
premature. It is now no longer so. I am at
home afternoons from 1 until 6 at 14, Little Bow
Street, EC3 (3rd floor, rear).</p>

<p class="rgt">Josephine Spencer Francis"</p></div>

<p>In spite of her rudeness at our last meeting, my good nature
caused me to send a cab for her. She wore the identical gray
suit of years before and her face was still unlined and dubiously
clean.</p>

<p>"How do you do, Miss Francis? I'm glad to find you among
the lucky ones. Nowadays if we don't hear from old friends
we automatically assume their loss."</p>

<p>She looked at me as one scans an acquaintance whose name
has been embarrassingly forgotten. "There is no profit for you
in this politeness, Weener," she said abruptly. "I am here to
beg a favor."</p>

<p>"Anything I can do for you, Miss Francis, will be a pleasure,"
I assured her.</p>

<p>She began using a toothpick, but it was not the oldfashioned
gold one&mdash;just an ordinary wooden splinter. "Hum. You remember
asking me to superintend gathering specimens of
<i>Cynodon dactylon</i>?"</p>

<p>"Circumstances have greatly altered since then," I answered.</p>

<p>"They have a habit of doing so. I merely mentioned your
offer because you coupled it with a chance to advance my own
research as an inducement. I am on the way to develop the
counteragent, but to advance further I need to make tests upon
the living grass itself. The World Control Congress has refused<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
me permission to use specimens. I have no private means of
evading their fiat."</p>

<p>"An excellent thing. The decrees of the congress are issued
for the protection of all."</p>

<p>"Hypocrisy as well as unctuousness."</p>

<p>"What do you expect me to do?"</p>

<p>"You have a hundred hireling chemists, all of them with a
string of degrees, at your service. I want to borrow two of them
and be landed on some American mountain, above the snowline,
where I can continue to work."</p>

<p>"Besides being illegal&mdash;to mention such a thing is apparently
hypocritical&mdash;such a hazardous and absurd venture is
hardly in the nature of a business proposition, Miss Francis."</p>

<p>"Philanthropic, then."</p>

<p>"I have given fifty thousand pounds to set up nurseryschools
right here in London&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So the mothers of the little brats will be free to work in
your factories."</p>

<p>"I have donated ten thousand pounds to Indian famine
relief&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So that you might cut the wages of your Hindu workers."</p>

<p>"I have subscribed five thousand pounds for sanitation in
Szechwan&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thereby lessening absenteeism from sickness among your
coolies."</p>

<p>"I will not stoop to answer your insinuations," I said. "I
merely mentioned my gifts to show that my charities are on a
worldwide scale and there is little room in them for the relief
of individuals."</p>

<p>"Do you think I come to you for a personal sinecure? I don't
ask if you have no concern outside selfish interest, for the
answer is immediate and obvious; but isnt it to that same selfish
interest to protect what remains of the world? If the other continents
go as North America has gone, will you alone be divinely
translated to some extraterrestrial sphere? And if so,
will you take your wealth and power with you?"</p>

<p>"I am supporting three laboratories devoted exclusively to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
antigraminous research and anyway the rest of the world is
amply protected by the oceans."</p>

<p>She removed the toothpick in order to laugh unpleasantly.
"Once a salesman always a salesman, Weener. Lie to yourself,
deny facts, brazen it out. The world was safe behind the saltband too,
in the days when Josephine Francis was a quack and
charlatan."</p>

<p>"Admitting your great attainments, Miss Francis, the fact
remains that you are a woman and the adventure you propose
is hardly one for a lady to undertake."</p>

<p>"Weener, you are ineffable. I'm not a lady&mdash;I'm a chemist."</p>

<p>The conversation deadlocked as I waited for her to go.
Oddly enough, in spite of her sex and the illegality of her proposal,
I was inclined to help her, if she had approached me in
a reasonable manner and not with the uncouth bearing of a
superior toward an inferior. If she <i>could</i> find a counteragent,
I thought ... if she could find a weapon, then the possibility
of utilizing the Grass as a raw material for food concentrates,
a design still tantalizingly just beyond the reach of our
researchworkers, might be realized. Labor costs would be cut
to a minimum....</p>

<p>I could not let the woman be her own worst enemy; I was
big enough to overlook her unfortunate attitudes and see
through the cranky exterior to the worthy idealist and true
woman beneath. I was interrupted in my thoughts by Miss
Francis speaking again.</p>

<p>"North American landtitles have no value right now, but a
man with money who knew ahead of time the Grass could be
destroyed ..."</p>

<p>How clumsy, I thought, trying to appeal to a cupidity I don't
possess; as if I would cheat people by buying up their very
homes for sordid speculation. "Miss Francis," I said, "purely
out of generosity and in remembrance of old times I am inclined
to consider helping you. I suppose you have the details
of the equipment you will need, the qualifications of your
assistants, and a rough idea of what mountain you might prefer
as a location?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course," and she began rattling off a catalogue of items,
stabbing the air with her toothpick as a sort of running punctuation.</p>

<p>I stopped her with a raised hand. "Please. Reduce your list
to writing and leave it with my secretary. I will see what can
be done."</p>

<p>As soon as she had gone I picked up the phone and cabled
Tony Preblesham to report to me immediately. The decision
to send him with Miss Francis had been instantaneous, but
had I thought about it for hours no happier design could have
been conceived. Outside of General Thario there was not another
man in my organization I could trust so implicitly. The
expedition required double, no, triple secrecy and Preblesham
could not only guard against any ulterior and selfish aims Miss
Francis might entertain&mdash;to say nothing of the erratic or purely
feminine impulses which could possibly operate to the disadvantage
of all concerned&mdash;but take the opportunity to give
the continent a general survey, both to keep in view the utilization
of the weed, whether or not it could be conquered; and
whatever possibilities a lay observer might see as to the Grass
perishing of itself.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Queen Elizabeth Hotel,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Perth, Western Australia, A.C.</span><br />
</p>

<p>"Dear Sir:&mdash;<br />
According to yr. instructions our party left Paramaribo
on the 9th inst. for Medellin, giving out that we were going
to see possible tin deposits near there. At Medellin I checked
with our men &amp; was told that work gangs with the stuff
needed to make landing fields together with caches of gas &amp;
oil, enough for 3 times the flying required had been dropped
both at Mt. Whitney &amp; on Banks Island. A. W., I tell you the
boys down there are on their toes. Of course I did not tell
them this, but gave them a real old fashioned Pep Talk, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>&amp;
told them if they really made good they might be moved up
to Rio or Copenhagen or may be even London.</p>

<p>"Every thing being O.K. in Medellin, we left on the 12th
inst., heading at first South to fool any nosey cops &amp; then
straight West so as to be out of range of the patrol boats. It
was quite late before we could head North and the navigator
was flying by instruments so it was not until dawn that
we saw land. You can sneer all you like at Bro. Paul (&amp; of
course he has not had the benefits of an Education like you,
A. W.) but I want to tell you that when I looked out of the
port &amp; saw nothing but green grass where houses &amp; trees &amp;
mtns. ought to have been, I remembered that I was a backslider
&amp; sinful man. However, this is beside the point.</p>

<p>"The lady professor, Miss Francis I mean, &amp; Mr. White
&amp; Mr. Black were both so excited they could hardly eat, but
kept making funny remarks in some foreign language which
I do not understand. However I do not think there was any
thing wrong or disloyal to you in their conversation.</p>

<p>"You would have thought that flying over so much green
would have got tiresome after some time, but you would
have been wrong. I am sorry I cannot describe it to you, but
I can only say again that it made me think of my Account
with my Maker.</p>

<p>"While I think of it, altho it does not belong here, in
Paramaribo I had to fire our local man as he had got into
trouble with the Police there &amp; was giving Cons. Pem. a bad
name. He said it was on the Firm's account, but I told him
you did not approve of breaking the Law at all.</p>

<p>"We had no trouble sighting the party at Mt. Whitney &amp;
I want to tell you, A. W., it was a great relief to get rid of the
Scientists altho they are no doubt all right in their way.
Some of the work gang kicked at being left behind altho
that was in our agreement. They said they were sick of the
snow &amp; the sight of the Grass beyond. I said we only had
room in the transport for the Banks Is. gang &amp; anyway they
would have company now. I promised them we would pick
them up on our next trip.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>"Miss Francis &amp; the 2 others acted like crazy. They kept
shaking each other's hands &amp; saying We are here, we are
here, altho any body but a Nut would have thought saying
it was a waste of time as even a small child could have seen
that they were. And any way, why any body should want to
be there is some thing beyond me.</p>

<p>"We took off from Whitney on the 14th inst., flying back
S. West. There were no land marks, but the navigator told
me when we were over the Site of L. A. I have to report that
the Grass looked no different in this Area, where it is the
oldest. Then we flew North E., looking for the Gt. Salt Lake
according to yr. instructions. I am sorry to say that we could
not find it altho we flew back &amp; forth for some time, searching
while the instruments were checked. The Lake has disappeared
in the Grass.</p>

<p>"We headed North E. by E., finding no land marks except
a few peaks above the snow on the Rocky Mtns. I am
very glad to say that the Gt. Lakes are still there, altho much
smaller &amp; L. Erie &amp; L. Ontario so shrunk I might have missed
them if the pilot had not pointed them out. The St. Lawrence
River is of course gone.</p>

<p>"We followed the line of the big Canadian Lakes N., but
except for Depressions (which may be Swamps) in the latitudes
of the Gt. Bear &amp; Gt. Slave Lakes, there is nothing but
Grass. We stayed over night at Banks Is. &amp; it was very cold
&amp; miserable, but we were happy to remember that there was
no Grass underneath the Snow below us. Next morning (the
16th) after fueling up we took off (with the ground crew)
for the Homeward trip.</p>

<p>"Stopping at Whitney, every thing was O.K. except that I
did not see the lady professor (Miss Francis, I mean) as
Mr. White and Mr. Black said she was too busy.</p>

<p class="nmp">"I will be in London to meet you on the 1st as arranged
&amp; give you any further news you want. Until then, I remain,</p>

<p class="signing">Yrs. Truly,<br />
A. Preblesham, Vice-Pres. in Chge of Field Operations, Cons. Pem."</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>I cannot say Preblesham's report was particularly enlightening,
but it at least squelched any notion the Grass might be
dying of itself. I did not expect any great results from the
scientists' expedition, but I felt it worth a gamble. In the meantime
I dismissed the lost continent from my mind and turned
to more immediate concerns.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">71.</span> <span class="num2">T</span>he disappearance of American
foundries and the withdrawal of the Russian products from
export after their second revolution had forced a boom in
European steel. English, French, and German manufacturers
of automobiles, rails, and locomotives, anticipating tremendously
enlarged outlets for their output&mdash;even if those new
markets still fell short of the demand formerly drawing upon
the American factories&mdash;had earmarked the entire world supply
for a long time to come.</p>

<p>Since I owned large blocks of stock, not only in the industries,
but in the rollingmills as well, this boom was profitable
to me. I had long since passed the point where it was necessary,
no matter how great my expenses or philanthropies, for me to
exert myself further; but as I have always felt anyone who
gains wealth without effort is no better than a parasite, I was
contracting for new plants in Bohemia, Poland, Northern Italy
and France. I did not neglect buying heavily into the Briey
Basin and into the Swedish oremines to ensure the future supply
of these mills. In spite of the able assistance of Stuart
Thario and the excellent spadework of Preblesham, I was so
busy at this time&mdash;for in addition to everything else the sale of
concentrates diagrammed an everascending spiral&mdash;that food
and sleep seemed to be only irritating curtailments of the
workingday.</p>

<p>It was the fashion when I was a youth for novelists to sneer
at businessmen and proclaim that the conduct of industry was
a simple affair, such as any halfwit could attend to with but a
portion of his mind. I wish these cynics could have come to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
know the delicate workings and balances of my intricate empire.
We in responsible positions, and myself most of all, were
on a constant alert, ready for instant decision or personal
attention to a mass of new detail at any moment.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">72.</span> <span class="num2">O</span>n one of the occasions when I had
to fly to Copenhagen it was Winifred and not General Thario
who met me at the airport. "General T is so upset," she explained
in her vivacious way, "that I had to come instead. But
perhaps I should have sent Pauline?"</p>

<p>I assured her I was pleased to see her and hastened to express
concern for her father.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's not him at all, really," she said. "It's Mama. She's
all bothered about Joe."</p>

<p>I lowered my voice respectfully and said I was sure Mrs
Thario was overcome with grief and perhaps I had better not
intrude at such a time.</p>

<p>"Poo!" dissented Winifred. "Mama doesnt know what grief
is. She's simply delighted at Joe's doing a Custer, but she's
awfully bothered about his music."</p>

<p>"In what way?" I asked. "Do you mean getting it performed?"</p>

<p>"Getting it performed, nothing. Getting it suppressed. That
a long line of generals and admirals should wind up in a composer
is to her a disgrace which will need a great deal of living
down. It preys on her mind. Poor old Stuart is home now reading
her choice passages from the <i>Winning of the West</i> by
Theodore Roosevelt to soothe her nerves."</p>

<p>I had been more than a little apprehensive of meeting Mama
again, but Winifred's report seemed to reassure me that she
would be confined, if not to bed, at least to her own apartments.
I was sadly disillusioned to find her ensconced in a
comfortable armchair beside a brightly burning fire, the general
with a book held open by his thumb. He greeted me with
his usual affection. "Albert, I'm sorry I wasnt able to get to
the airport."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>I shook his hand and turned to his wife. "I regret to hear
you are indisposed, Mrs Thario."</p>

<p>"Spare me your damned crocodile tears. Where is my son?"</p>

<p>"In his last letter he suggested he would remain in our country
as long as it existed; however it is possible&mdash;even probable
he escaped. Let us hope so, Mrs Thario."</p>

<p>"That's the sort of damned hogwash you feed to green
troops, not to veterans. My son is dead. In action. My grandfather
went the same way at Chancellorsville. Do you think
me some whimpering broompusher to weep at the loss of a son
on the battlefield?"</p>

<p>Stuart Thario put his hand on her arm. "Easy ... bloodpressure
... no excitement."</p>

<p>"Not in regimentals," said Mama, and relapsed into silence.</p>

<p>We had a very uneasy dinner, during which we were unable
to discuss business owing to the presence of the ladies. Afterward
the general and I withdrew with our coffee&mdash;he did not
drink at home, so I missed the clarity which always accompanied
his indulgence&mdash;and were deep in figures and calculations
when Winifred summoned us hastily.</p>

<p>"General, Mr Weener, come quickly! Mama ..."</p>

<p>We hurried into the living room, I for one anticipating
Mama if not in the throes of a stroke at least in a faint. But she
was standing upright before the open fire, an unsheathed cavalry
saber in her hand. It was clearly a family relic, for from its
guard dangled the golden tassel of the United States Army and
on its naked blade were little spots of rust, but it looked dangerous
enough as she warned us off with a sweep of it. In her
other hand I recognized the bulky manuscript of George
Thario's First Symphony which she was burning, page by page.</p>

<p>"Some damned impostor," she said. "Some damned impostor."</p>

<p>"Harriet," protested the general, "Harriet, please ... the
boy's work ... only copy ..."</p>

<p>She fed another leaf to the fire. "... impostor ..."</p>

<p>"Harriet&mdash;" he advanced toward her, but she waved him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
away with the sharp blade&mdash;"can't burn George's work this
way ... gave his life ..."</p>

<p>I had not thought highly of Joe's talents as a musician, believing
them byandlarge to be but reflections of his unfortunate
affectations. I think I can say I appreciate good music
and Ive often taken a great deal of pleasure from hearing a
hotelband play Rubinstein's Melody in F, or like classical
numbers, during mealtimes. But even if Joe's symphony was
but a series of harsh and disjointed sounds, I thought its destruction
a dreadful thing for Mama to do and the more shocking,
aside from any question of artistic taste, because of its
reversal of all we associate with the attitude of true motherhood.</p>

<p>"Mrs Thario," I protested, "as your son's friend I beg you
to consider&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Impudence," declared Mama, pointing the sword at me so
that I involuntarily backed up although already at a respectful
distance.</p>

<p>"Damned impudence," she repeated, feeding another page
to the fire. "Came into my house, bold as brass and said, 'Cream
if you please.' Ha! I'll cream him, I will!" And she made a
violent gesture with the saber as though skewering me upon
its length.</p>

<p>I whispered to Constance, who was standing closest, that her
mother had undoubtedly lost her reason and should be forcibly
restrained. Unhappily the old lady's keen ears caught my
suggestion.</p>

<p>"Oho. 'Deranged,' am I? I spend my life making more
money than I can spend, do I? I push my way against all decency
into the company of my betters, boring them and myself
for no earthly reason, do I? I live on crackers and milk because
Ive spent my nervous energy piling up the means to buy an
endless supply of steaks and chops my doctor forbids me to
eat? I starve my employees half to death in order to give the
money I steal from them to some charity which hands a small
part of it back, ay? I hire lobbyists or bribe officials to pass
laws and then employ others to break them? I foster nationalist<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
organizations with one hand and build up international
cartels with the other, do I? I'm crazy, am I?"</p>

<p>Excited by her own rhetoric she put several pages at once
into the flames. Constance pleaded, "Mama, this is all we have
left of Joe. Please, Mama."</p>

<p>"Sundays the church banner is raised above the Flag. I
never heard a post chaplain say immortality was contained on
pieces of paper."</p>

<p>"Comfort, then, Mama," suggested Winifred.</p>

<p>"Creative work," muttered the general.</p>

<p>"Is it some trivial thing to endure the pangs of childbed
that the creations of men are so exalted? I have offered my life
on a battlefield no less and no more than my grandfather
fought on at Chancellorsville. Little minds do not judge, but
I judge. I bore a son; he was my extension as this weapon is
my extension."</p>

<p>She thrust the sword forward to emphasize her utterance.
"I will not hesitate to judge my son. If he did not die in proper
uniform at least I shall not have him go down as a maker of
piano notes instead of buglecalls." She threw the balance of
the score into the fire and stirred it into a blaze with the steel's
point.</p>

<p>The ringing of the telephonebell put a period to the scene.
Constance, who spoke several languages, answered it. She carried
on an incomprehensible conversation for a minute and
then motioned to me with her head. "It's for you, Mr Weener.
Rio. I'll wait till they get the connection through." She
turned to the mouthpiece again and encouraged the operator
with a soothing flow of words.</p>

<p>I was vastly relieved at the interruption. It was undoubtedly
Preblesham calling me on some routine matter, but it
served to distract attention from the still muttering old lady
and give her a chance to subside.</p>

<p>Preblesham's voice came in a bodiless waver over the miles.
"A W? Can you hear me? I can give you a tip. Just about three
hours ahead of the radio and newspapers. Can you understand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
me? Our big competitor has bought the adjoining property.
Do you get me, A W?"</p>

<p>I nodded at the receiver as though he could see me, my
thoughts racing furiously ahead. I had understood him all
right: the Grass had somehow jumped the saltwater gap and
was loose upon another continent.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">73.</span> <span class="num2">I</span> had about three hours in which to
dispose of all my South American holdings before their value
vanished. Telephone facilities in the Thario house, though
adequate for the transaction of the general's daily business,
were completely unequal to the emergency. Even if they had
not been, Mama's occasional sallies from her fireplace fort,
saber waving threateningly, frequently endangered half our
communications and we suffered all the while from the idiosyncrasies
of the continental operators who seem unable ever
to make a clear connection, varying this annoyance by a habit
of either dropping dead or visiting the nearest caf&eacute; at those
crucial moments when they did not interrupt a tense interchange
by polite inquiries as to whether msieu had been
connected.</p>

<p>I must say that in this crisis Stuart Thario displayed all his
soldierly qualities to the full. Sweeping aside his domestic concerns
as he would at the order of mobilization, he became swift,
decisive, vigorous. The first call he put through was to the
Kristian IV Hotel, engaging every available empty room so
that we might preempt as much of the switchboard as possible.
Pressing Constance and Winifred into service as secretaries
until his own officestaff could be summoned and leaving
Pauline to deal with Mama, he had us established in the hotel
less than threequarters of an hour from the time Preblesham
phoned.</p>

<p>Even as the earliest calls were being put through a barely
perceptible signal passed from the general to Winifred and
presently large parts of the Kristian IV bar were being arranged
on a long table at the general's elbow. I had little time<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
for observation since I had to exert all my powers of salesmanship
on unseen financiers to persuade them by indirection that
I was facing a financial crisis and they had a chance to snap up
my South American holdings at fractions of their values; but
out of the corner of my eye I admired the way Stuart Thario
continuously sipped from his constantly refilled glass without
hesitating in his duplicating endeavors.</p>

<p>I expected the news to break and end our efforts at any
moment, but the quickness with which I had seized upon
Preblesham's information confirmed the proverb about the
early bird; the threehour reprieve stretched to five and by the
time Havas flashed the news I had liquefied almost all of my
now worthless assets&mdash;and to potential financial rivals. Needless
to say I had not trusted solely to the honor of the men
with whom I had conversed, but had the sale confirmed in
each case by an agent on the spot who accepted a check, draft,
or cash from the buyer. Only on paper did I suffer the slightest
loss; in actuality my position became three times as strong as
before.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">74.</span> <span class="num2">T</span>he world took the extension of the
Grass to South America with a philosophic calm which can
only be described as amazing. Even the Latins themselves
seemed more concerned with how the Grass had jumped the
gap than with the impending fate of their continent. The
generally accepted theory was that it had somehow mysteriously
come by way of the West Indies, although as yet the
Grass had not appeared on any of those islands, and even
Cuba, within sight of the submerged Florida Keys, was apparently
safe behind her protective supercyclone fans. But the
fact the Grass had appeared first at Medellin in Colombia
rather than in the tiny bit of Panama remaining seemed to
show it had not come directly from the daggerpointed mass
poised above the continent.</p>

<p><i>La Prensa</i> of Buenos Aires said in a long editorial entitled
"Does Humanity Betray Itself?": "When the Colossus of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
North was evilly enchanted, many Americans (except possibly
our friends across the River Plate) breathed more easily.
Now it would seem their rejoicing was premature and the
doom of the Yankee is also to be the doom of our older civilization.
How did this verdant disease spread from one continent
to another? That is the question which tortures every
human heart from the Antarctic to the Caribbean.</p>

<p>"It is believed the cordon around North America has not
been generally respected. Scientists with the noblest motives,
and adventurers urged on by the basest, are alike believed to
have visited the forbidden continent. It may well be that on one
of these trips the seeds of the gigantic <i>Cynodon dactylon</i> were
brought back. It is well known that the agents of a certain
Yankee capitalist have been accustomed to taking off on mysterious
journeys near the very spot now afflicted by the emerald
plague."</p>

<p>It was a dastardly hint and the sort of thing I had long come
to look upon as inseparable from my position. Of all peoples
the Latinamericans have long been known as the most notoriously
ungrateful for the work we did in developing their
countries. Why, in some backward parts, the natives had been
content to live by hunting and fishing till we furnished them
with employment and paid them enough so they could buy salt
fish and canned meats. Fortunately <i>La Prensa</i>'s innuendo, so
obviously inspired by envy, was not taken up, and attention
soon turned from the insoluble problem of the bridging of
the gap to the southward progress of the weed itself.</p>

<p>From the very first, everyone took for granted the victory
of the Grass. No concerted efforts were made either to confine
or to destroy it. The World Congress to Combat the Grass, far
from being inactive, worked heroically, but it got little cooperation
from the peoples most closely affected. When at one
time it seemed as though the congress had got hold of a possible
weapon, the Venezuelans refused them the necessary sites
and Brazil would not allow passage of foreign soldiers over its
soil. Nationalism suddenly became rampant. "We will die as
Ecuadorians, descendants of the Incas," exclaimed the leading<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
newspaper of Quito. <i>El Gaucho</i> of Lima pointed out caustically
that most of Ecuador's area really belonged to Peru and
the Peruvians were the true descendants of the Incas anyway.
"We shall all die as unashamed Peruvians!" thundered
<i>El Gaucho</i>.</p>

<p>In vain the Church pointed out the difference between
Christian resignation and sinful suicide. The reply of most
South Americans, when they bothered to reply at all, was
either that the coming of the Grass expressed God's will toward
them or else to scorn the Church entirely. Imitations of
Brother Paul's movement flourished, with additions and refinements
suited to the Latin temperament.</p>

<p>So the efforts of the World Congress were almost entirely
limited to searching each ship, plane, and individual leaving
the doomed continent to be sure none of the fatal seeds were
transported. Even this precaution was resented as an infringement
on national sovereignty, but the resentment was limited
to bellicose pronouncements in the newspapers; the republics
looked on sullenly while their honor was systematically violated
by phlegmatic inspectors.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">75.</span> <span class="num2">T</span>he Grass grew to unheardof heights
in the tropical valley of the Amazon. It washed the slopes of
the Andes as it had the Cordilleras and the Rockies, leaving
only the highest peaks free of its presence. It raced across the
llanos, the savannas and the pampas and covered the high
plateaus in a slow relentless growth.</p>

<p>The people ran from the Grass, not in a straight line from
north to south, but by indirection, seeking first the seacoasts
and then escape from the afflicted land. Those North Americans
who had eluded the Grass once did not satisfy themselves
with halfmeasures when their sanctuary was lost, but bought
passage on any bottom capable, however dubiously, of keeping
out the sea and embarked for the farthest regions.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">76.</span> <span class="num2">I</span>n point of time, I am now about halfway
through my narrative. It is hard to believe that only
eleven years have passed since the Grass conquered South
America; indeed, it is extraordinarily difficult for me to reconstruct
these middle years at all. Not because they were hard or
unpleasant&mdash;on the contrary, they carried me from one success
to another&mdash;but because they have, in memory, the dreamlike
quality of unreality, elusive, vague and tantalizing.</p>

<p>Like a dream, too, was the actual progress of the Grass. We
were all, I think, impressed by the sense of repetition, of a
scene enacted over and over again. It was this quality which
gives my story, now that I look back upon it, a certain distortion,
for no one, hearing it for the first time, and not as any
reader of these words must be, thoroughly familiar with the
events, could believe in the efforts made to combat the Grass.
These efforts existed; we did not yield without struggles; we
fought for South America as we had fought for North America.
But it was a nightmare fight; our endeavors seem retrospectively
those of the paralyzed....</p>

<p>The Grass gripped the continent's great northern bulge,
squeezed it into submission and worked its way southward to
the slender tip, driving the inhabitants before it, duplicating
previous acts by sending an influx from sparsely to thickly settled
areas, creating despair, terror, disruption and confusion;
pestilence, hysteria and famine.</p>

<p>The drama was not played through in one act, but many; to
a world waiting the conclusion it dragged on through interminable
months and years, offering no change, no sudden twists
of fortune, no elusive hopes. At last, mercifully, the tragedy
ended; the green curtain came down and covered the continent
to the Strait of Magellan. The Grass looked wistfully
across at Tierra del Fuego, the land of ice and fire, but even
its voracity balked, momentarily at any rate, at the inhospitable
island and left it to whatever refugees chose its shores as
a slower but still certain death.</p>

<p>South America finally gone, the rest of the globe breathed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
easier. It would be a slander on humanity to say there was
actual rejoicing when the World Congress sealed off this continent
too, but whatever sorrow was felt for its loss was balanced
by the feeling that at long last the peril of the Grass was
finally ended. No longer would speculative Germans, thoughtful
Chinese or wakeful Englishmen wonder if the supercyclone
fans were indeed an effective barrier; no longer would Cubans,
Colombians or Venezuelans look northward apprehensively.
Oceanic barriers now confined the peril and though the world
was shrunken and hurt it was yet alive. More, it was free from
fear for the first time since the mutated seeds had blown over
the saltband.</p>

<p>I must not give the impression that a wiping off of the Grass
from the accountbooks of humanity was universal and complete.
The World Congress periodically considered proposals
for countermeasures. On the top of Mount Whitney Miss Francis
still labored. New assistants were flown to her as the old
ones wandered down the great rockslide from the old stone
weatherhouse off into the Grass during fits of despondency,
went mad from the realization that, except for problematical
survivors on the polar caps, they were alone in an abandoned
hemisphere, or died of simple homesickness. In the researchlaboratories
of Consolidated Pemmican formulas for utilizing
the Grass were still tinkered with, and the death of almost
every publicspirited man of fortune revealed a will containing
bequests to aid those seeking means of controlling the weed.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">77.</span> <span class="num2">I</span>t is not, afterall, a detached history
of the past twentyone years I am writing. Contemporaries are
only too well aware of the facts and posterity will find them
dehydrated in textbooks. I started out to tell of my own personal
part in the coming of the Grass, not to take an Olympian
and aloof view of the passion of man.</p>

<p>The very mention of a personal part brings to mind a subject
which might be painful were I of a petty nature. There
were people who, willfully blind to the facts, held me responsible,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
in the face of all reason, for the Grass itself. Although it
is difficult to believe, there have been many occasions when I
have been denounced by demagogues and my blood called for
by vicious mobs.</p>

<p>But enough of morbid retrospection. I think I can say at this
time there was, with the exception of certain Indian nabobs,
hardly a wealthy man left in the world who did not owe in
some way the retention of his riches to me. I controlled more
than half the steel industry; I owned outright the majority
stocks of the world oil cartel; coal, iron, copper, tin and other
mines either belonged directly to me or to tributary companies
in which I held large interests.</p>

<p>Along with the demagoguery of attributing the Grass to
Albert Weener there was the agitation for socialism and the
expropriation of all private property, the attempt to deprive
men of the fruit of their endeavor and reduce everyone to a
regimented, miserable level. It is hardly necessary to say that
I spared no effort to combat the insidious agents of the Fourth
International. Fortunately for the preservation of the free
enterprise system, I had tools ready to hand.</p>

<p>The overrunning of the United States wiped out the gangs
which operated so freely there, but remnants made their escape,
taking with them to the older continents their philosophy
of life and property. Gathering native recruits, they began
following the familiar patterns and would in time no doubt
have divided the world into countless minute baronies.</p>

<p>However, I was able to subsidize and reason with enough of
their leaders to persuade them that their livelihood and very
existence rested on a basis of private property and that their
great danger came not from each other, but from the advocates
of socialism. They saw the point, and though they did not
cease from warring on each other, or mulcting the general
public, they were ruthless in exterminating the socialists and
they left the goods and adjuncts of Consolidated Pemmican
and Allied Industries scrupulously unmolested.</p>

<p>Strange as it sounds, it was not my part in protecting the
world from the philosophy of equality, nor my ramified properties,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
which gave me my unique position. Unbelievably, because
the change had occurred so gradually, industry, though
still a vital factor, no longer played the dominant role in the
world, but had given the position back to an earlier occupant.
Food was once more paramount in global economy. Loss of
the Americas had cut the supply in half without reducing the
population correspondingly. The Socialist Union remained
selfsufficient and uninterested, while Australia, New Zealand
and the cultivated portions of Africa strove to feed the millions
of Europeans and Asiatics whose lands could not grow
enough for their own use. The slightest falling off of the harvest
produced famine.</p>

<p>At this point Consolidated Pemmican practically took over
the entire business of agriculture. Utilizing byproducts, and
crops otherwise not worth gathering, waste materials, and
growths inedible without processing, with plants strung out
all over the four continents and with tremendously reduced
shipping costs because of the small compass in which so much
food could be contained, we were able to let our customers
earn their daily concentrates by gathering the raw materials
which went into them. I was not only the wealthiest, most
powerful man in the world, but its savior and providence as
well.</p>

<p>With the new feeling of security bathing the world, tension
dissolved into somnolence and the tempo of daily life slackened
until it scarcely seemed to move at all. The waves of anxiety,
suspicion and distrust of an earlier decade calmed into
peaceful ripples, hardly noticeable in a pondlike existence.</p>

<p>No longer beset by thoughts or fears of wars, nations relaxed
their pride, armies were reduced to little more than
palaceguards, brassbands and parade units; while navies were
kept up&mdash;if periodic painting and retaining in commission a
few obsolete cruisers and destroyers be so termed&mdash;only to
patrol the Atlantic and Pacific shores of the lost hemisphere.</p>

<p>The struggle for existence almost disappeared; the wagescales
set by Consolidated Pemmican were enough to sustain
life, and in a world of limited horizons men became content<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
with that. The bickering characteristic of industrial dispute
vanished; along with it went the outmoded weapon of the
tradesunion. It was a halcyon world and if, as cranks complained,
illiteracy increased rapidly, it could only be because
with everyman's livelihood assured his natural indolence took
the upper hand and he not only lost refinements superficially
acquired, but was uninterested in teaching them to his
children.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">78.</span> <span class="num2">I</span> don't know how I can express the
golden, sunlit quality of this period. It was not an heroic age,
no great deeds were performed, no conflicts resolved, no fundamentshaking
ideas broached. Quiet, peace, content&mdash;these
were the keywords of the era. Preoccupation with politics and
panaceas gave place to healthier interests: sports and pageants
and giant fairs. Men became satisfied with their lot and if they
to a great extent discarded speculation and disquieting philosophies
they found a useful substitute in quiet meditation.</p>

<p>Until now I had never had the time to live in a manner
befitting my station; but with my affairs running so smoothly
that even Stuart Thario and Tony Preblesham found idle time,
I began to turn my attention to the easier side of life. Of course
I never considered making my permanent home anywhere but
in England; for all its parochialism and oddities it was the
nearest I could come to approximating my own country.</p>

<p>I bought a gentleman's park in Hampshire and had the outmoded
house torn down. It had been built in Elizabethan
times and was cold, drafty and uncomfortable, with not one
modern convenience. For a time I considered preserving it
intact as a sort of museumpiece and building another home
for myself on the grounds, but when I was assured by experts
that Tudor architecture was not considered to be of surpassing
merit and I could find in addition no other advantageous
site, I ordered its removal.</p>

<p>I called in the best architects for consultation, but my own
artistic and practical sense, as they themselves were quick to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
acknowledge, furnished the basis for the beautiful mansion
I put up. Moved by nostalgic memories of my lost Southland I
built a great and ample bungalow of some sixty rooms&mdash;stucco,
topped with asbestos tile. Since the Spanish motif natural to
this form would have been out of place in England and therefore
in bad taste, I had timbers set in the stucco, although of
course they performed no function but that of decoration, the
supports being framework which was not visible.</p>

<p>It was delightful and satisfying to come into the spacious
and cozy livingroom, filled with overstuffed easychairs and
comfortable couches, warmed by the most efficient of centralheating
systems or to use one of the perfectly appointed bathrooms
whose every fixture was the best money could buy and
recall the dank stone floors and walls leading up to a mammoth
and&mdash;from a thermal point of view&mdash;perfectly useless
fireplace flanked by the coatsofarms of deadandgone gentry
who were content to shuffle out on inclement mornings to
answer nature's calls in chilly outhouses.</p>

<p>So large and commodious an establishment required an
enormous staff of servants, which in turn called for a housekeeper
and a steward to supervise their activities, for as I
have observed many times, the farther down one goes on the
wagescale the more it is necessary to hire a highsalaried executive
to see that the wage is earned.</p>

<p>I cannot say in general that I ever learned to distinguish
between one retainer and another, except of course my personal
manservant and Burlet, the headbutler whom I hired
right from under the nose of the Marquis of Arpers&mdash;his lordship
being unable to match my offer. But in spite of the confusion
caused by such a multiplicity of menials, I one day
noticed an undergardener whose face was tantalizingly familiar.
He touched his cap respectfully as I approached, but
I had the curious feeling that it was a taught gesture and not
one which came naturally to him.</p>

<p>"Have you been here long, my good man?" I asked, still
trying to place him.</p>

<p>"No, sir," he answered, "about two weeks."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>"Funny. I'm almost certain Ive noticed you before."</p>

<p>He shook his head and made a tentative gesture with the
hoe or rake or whatever the tool was in his hand, as though
he would now, with my permission, resume his labors.</p>

<p>"What is your name?" I inquired, not believing it would
jog my memory, but out of a natural politeness toward inferiors
who always feel flattered by such attention.</p>

<p>"Dinkman," he muttered. "Adam Dinkman."</p>

<p>... That incredibly dilapidated frontlawn, overrun with
sickly devilgrass and spotted with bald patches. Mrs Dinkman's
mean bargaining with a tired man who was doing no
more than trying to make a living and her later domineering
harshness toward someone who was in no way responsible for
the misfortune which overcame her. I wondered if she were
still alive or had lost her life in the Grass while an indigent
on public charity. It is indeed a small world, I thought, and
how far we have both come since I humbled myself in order
to put food in my stomach and keep a roof over my head.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Dinkman," I said, turning away.</p>

<p>A warm feeling for a fellow American caused me to call in
my steward and bid him give Dinkman &pound;100, a small fortune
to an undergardener, and let him go. Though he might not
realize it immediately, I was doing him a tremendous favor,
for an American with &pound;100 in England was bound to do better
for himself in some small business than he could hope to
do as a mere servant.</p>

<p>Looking back upon this too brief time of tranquillity and
satisfaction I cannot help but sigh for its passing. Preceded
and followed by periods of turbulence and stress, it stands out
in my life as an incredible moment, a soothing dream. Perhaps
a faint defect, so small as to be almost unnoticed, was a
feeling of solitariness&mdash;an inevitable concomitant of my position&mdash;but
this was so slight that I could not even define it as
loneliness and like many another defect it merely heightened
the charm of the whole.</p>

<p>I had wealth, power, the respect of the world. The unavoidable
detachment from the mob was mitigated by simple pleasures.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
My estate was a constant delight; the quaint survivals of
feudalism among the tenantry amused me; and though I could
not bring myself to pretend an interest in the absurd affectation
of foxhunting, I was well received by the county people,
whose insularity and aloofness I found greatly exaggerated,
perhaps by outsiders not as cosmopolitan as myself.</p>

<p>Excursions to London and other cities where my presence
was demanded or could be helpful afforded me a frequent
change of scene and visits by important people as well as more
intimate ones by Preblesham and the Tharios prevented The
Ivies&mdash;for so my place was called&mdash;from ever becoming dull to
me.</p>

<p>The general fell in love with a certain ale which was brewed
on the premises and declared, in spite of his lifelong rule to
the contrary, that it could be mixed with Irish whisky to make
a drink so agreeable that no sane man would want a better.
The girls, particularly Winifred, were enchanted with my
private woods, the gardens and the deerpark; but Mama,
throughout their visits, remained almost entirely silent and
aloof except for the rare remarks which seemed to burst from
her as though by an inescapable inward compulsion. These
were always insulting and always directed at me, but I overlooked
them, knowing her to be deranged.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">79.</span> <span class="num2">P</span>erhaps one of the things I most
enjoyed about The Ivies was wandering through its acres,
breathing through my pores, as it were, the sense of possession.
I was walking through the cowslips and violets punctuating
the meadow bordering one of the many little streams, when I
came upon a fellow roughly dressed, the pockets of his shootingjacket
bulging and a fishingline in his hand. For a moment
I thought him one of the gamekeepers and nodded, but his
quick look and furtive gestures instantly revealed him as a
poacher.</p>

<p>"Youre trespassing, you know," I said with some severity.</p>

<p>"I know, guvner," he admitted readily, "but I wasnt doing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
no harm; just looking at this bit of water here and listening
to the birds."</p>

<p>"With a fishingline in your hands?"</p>

<p>"Well, now, guvner, that's by way of being a precaution.
You see, when I go out on a little expedition like this, to inspect
the beauties of nature&mdash;which I admit I have no right to
do, they being on someone else's land&mdash;I always say to myself,
'Suppose you run into some gent looking at a lovely fat trout
in a brook and he hasnt got no fishline with him? What could
be more philanthropic than I produce my bit of string and
help him out?' Aint that a proper Christian attitude, guvner?"</p>

<p>"Possibly; but what, may I ask, makes your pockets bulge
so suspiciously? Is that another philanthropy?"</p>

<p>"Accident, guvner, sheer accident. Walking along like this
with my head down I always seem to come upon two or three
dead hares or now and then a partridge or grouse. Natural
mortality, you understand. Well, what could be more humane
than to stuff them in my pockets and take them home for
proper burial?"</p>

<p>"You know in spite of all the Labour Governments and
strange doings in Parliament, there are still pretty strict laws
against poaching."</p>

<p>"Poaching, guvner? I wouldnt poach. I respect what's yours,
just as I respect what's my own. Trespassing maybe. I likes to
look at a little bit of sky or hear a meadowlark or smell a flower
or two, but poaching&mdash;! Really, guvner, you hadnt ought to
take away a man's character."</p>

<p>I thought it a shame so sturdy and amusing a fellow should
have to eke out his living so precariously. "I'll tell you what
I'll do," I said. "I'll give you a note right now to my head
gamekeeper and have him put you on as an assistant. Thirty
shillings a week I think it pays."</p>

<p>"Well, now, thank you, guvner, but really, I don't want it.
Thirty bob a week! What should I do with it? Nothing but go
down to the Holly Tree and get drunk every night. I'm much
better off as I am&mdash;total abstinence, in a manner of speaking.
No, no, guvner, I appreciate your big heart, but I'm happy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
with my little bit of fish and a rabbit in the pot&mdash;why should I
set up to be an honest workingman and get dissatisfied with
my life?"</p>

<p>His refusal of my wellintentioned offer did not irk me. In
a large and tolerant view you could almost say we were both
parasites upon The Ivies and it would not hurt me if he stole
a little of my game to keep himself alive. I gave him a note to
protect him against any of the keepers who might come upon
him as I had, and we parted with mutual liking; I remembering
for my part that I was an American and all men, poacher
and landlord alike, were created equal, no matter how far
each had come from his beginnings.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">80.</span> <span class="num2">S</span>hortly after, Miss Francis ended
her long sojourn at Mount Whitney and returned to England.
The ordeal of living surrounded by the Grass, which had destroyed
her assistants, seemed to have made no other change in
her than the fading of her hair, which was now completely
white, and a loss of weight, giving her a deceptive appearance
of fragility at variance with the forthrightness of her manner.</p>

<p>I put down her immunity to agoraphobia as just another
evidence that she was already mad. Her refusal to accept the
limitations of her sex and her complete indifference to our respective
stations were mere confirmations. With her usual
disregard of realities she assumed I would go on financing her
indefinitely in spite of the hundreds of thousands of pounds
I had paid out without visible result.</p>

<p>"Ive really got it now, Weener," she assured me in a tone
hardly befitting a suppliant for funds. "In spite of the incompetents
you kept sending, in spite of mistakes and blind alleys,
the work on Whitney is done&mdash;and successfully. The rest is
routine laboratory work&mdash;a matter of quantities and methods
of application."</p>

<p>"I don't know that I can spare you any more money, Miss
Francis."</p>

<p>She laughed. "What the devil's the matter with you,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
Weener? Are your millions melting away? Or do you think
any of the spies you set on me capable of carrying on&mdash;or are
you just trying to crack the whip?"</p>

<p>"I set no spies and I have no whip. I merely feel it may not
be profitable to waste any more money on fruitless experiments."</p>

<p>She snorted. "Time has streamlined and inflated your platitudes.

would almost think you had no interest in finding a method
to counter the Grass."</p>

<p>Her egomania and impertinence were really insufferable;
her notion of her own importance was ludicrous.</p>

<p>"Interested or not, I have no reason to believe you alone
are capable of scientific discovery. Anyway, the world seems
pretty well off as it is."</p>

<p>She tugged at her hair as if it were false and would come off
if she jerked hard enough. "Of course it's well enough off from
your pointofview. It offers you more food than you could eat
if you had a million bellies, more clothes than you could wear
out in a million years, more houses than you could live in if
the million contradictions which go to make up any single
human were suddenly made corporeal. Of course youre satisfied;
why shouldnt you be? If the Grass were to be pushed back
and the world once more enlarged, if hope and dissatisfaction
were again to replace despair and content, you might not find
yourself such a big toad in a small puddle&mdash;and you wouldnt
like that, would you?"</p>

<p>I had intended all along to give her a small pension to keep
her from want and allow her to putter around, but her irrational
accusations and insults only showed her to be the kind
from whom no gratitude could be expected.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid we can be of no further use to each other."</p>

<p>"Look here, Weener, you can't do this. The life of civilization
depends on countering the Grass. Don't tell me the world
can go on only half alive. Look around you and notice the
recession every day. Outside of your own subservient laboratories<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
what scientific work is being done? Since Palomar and
Mount Wilson and Flagstaff went what has happened in
astronomy? If you pick up the shrunken pages of your <i>Times</i>
or <i>Tatler</i>, do you wonder at the reason for their shrinkage or
do you realize there are fewer literates in the world than there
were ten years ago?</p>

<p>"The Americas were upstart continents, werent they? I am
not speaking sarcastically, my point is not a chauvinistic one,
not even hemispherically prideful. And the Old World the
womb of culture? But how much culture has that womb borne
since the Americas disappeared? Without a doubt there are
exactly the same number of composers and painters, writers
and sculptors alive on the four continents today as there were
when there were six, but in this drowsy halfworld how many
books of importance are being produced?"</p>

<p>"There are plenty of books already in existence; besides,
those things go by cycles."</p>

<p>"God give me patience; this is the man who has humanity
prostrate."</p>

<p>"Humanity seems quite content in the position you ascribe
to it."</p>

<p>"Of course, of course&mdash;that's the tragedy. It's content the
same way a man who has just had his legs cut off is content;
suffering from shock and loss of blood he enters a merciful
coma from which he may never emerge. The legs do not write
the books or think the thoughts, whether these activities wait
for the cyclical moment or not, but the brain, dependent on
the circulation of the blood and the wellbeing of the rest of the
body for proper functioning. And who are you, little man, to
stand in the way of assisting the patient?"</p>

<p>"I shall not argue with you any further, Miss Francis. If
mankind is really as subject to your efforts as your conceit leads
you to believe then I am sure you will find some way to continue
them."</p>

<p>"I'm sure I will," she said, and we left it at that.</p>

<p>To say her accusations had been gravely unjust would be
to defend myself where no defense is called for. I merely remark<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
in passing that I gave orders to set aside a still greater
fund toward finding a reagent against the Grass, and to put
those who had lately assisted Miss Francis in charge. I did this,
not because I swallowed her strained analogy about a sufferer
with his legs cut off, but for purely practical reasons. The
world was very well as it was, but an effective weapon against
the Grass might at last make possible the neverdiscarded
vision of utilizing it beneficially.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">81.</span> <span class="num2">M</span>eanwhile life went on with a
smoothness strange and gratifying to those of us born into a
period of strife and restlessness. No more wars, strikes, riots,
agitation for higher wages or social experiments by wildeyed
fanatics. Those whose limitations laid out a career of toil performed
their function with as much efficiency as one could
expect and we others who had risen and separated ourselves
from the herd carried our responsibilities and accepted the
rewards which went with them. The ships of the World Congress
continued patrolling the coasts of the deserted continents
and restrictions were so far relaxed as to permit planeflights
over the area to take motionpictures and confirm the Grass
had lost none of its vigor. Beyond this, the generality of mankind
forgot the weed and the regions it covered, living geographically
as though Columbus had never set forth from
Palos.</p>

<p>It was at this time a new philosophic idea was advanced&mdash;giving
the lie to Miss Francis' dictum that no new thoughts
were being thought&mdash;which was, briefly, that the Grass was
essentially a good thing in itself; that the world had not merely
made the best of a bad situation, but had been brought to a
beneficent condition through the loss of the Western Hemisphere.
Mankind had desperately needed a brake upon its
heedless course; some instrumentality to limit it and bring it
to realization of its proper province. The Grass had acted as
such an agent and now, rightly chastised, man could go about
his fit business.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>This concept gained almost immediate popular support, so
far as it filtered down to the masses at all; prominent schoolmen
endorsed it wholeheartedly; statesmen gave it qualified
approval&mdash;"in principle"&mdash;and the Pope issued an encyclical
calling for a return of Christian resignation and submission.
Hardly was the ink dry upon the expressions of thanksgiving
for the punishment which had brought about a new and better
frameofmind than the philosophy was suddenly and dramatically
tested by events.</p>

<p>The island of Juan Fernandez, Robinson Crusoe's island, a
peak pushed out of the waters of the Pacific 400 miles west of
Chile, densely populated with refugees and a base for patrolboats,
was overrun by the Grass. It was an impossible happening.
Every inhabitant had had personal experience of the Grass
and was fearfully alert against its appearance. The patrols
covered the sea between it and the mainland constantly; the
distance was too far for windborne seeds. The tenuous hypothesis
that gulls had acted as carriers was accepted simply
for want of a better.</p>

<p>But the World Congress wasted no time looking backward.
Although between Juan Fernandez and the next land westward
the distance was three times greater than between it and
South America, the Congress seized upon the only island to
which it could possibly spread, Sala-y-Gomez, and made of it
a veritable fortress against the Grass. Not only did ships guard
its waters by day and keep it brilliantly lit with their searchlights
at night, but swift pursuitplanes bristling with machineguns
brought down every bird in flight within a thousand
miles.</p>

<p>The island itself was sown with salt a halfmile thick after
being mined with enough explosives to blow it into the sea.
The world, or that portion of it which had not fully accepted
all the implications of the doctrine of submission, watched
eagerly. But the ships patrolled an empty sea, the searchlights
reflected only the glittering saline crystals, the migrant birds
never reached their destination. The outpost held, impregnable.
Again everyone breathed easier.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>Five hundred miles beyond this focalpoint, its convict
settlement long abandoned, was Easter Island, Rapa Nui,
home of the great monoliths whose origin had ever been a
puzzle. Erect or supine, these colossal statues were strewn all
over the island. Anthropologists and archaeologists still came
to give them cursory inspection and it was on such a visit an
unmistakable clump of Grass was found.</p>

<p>Immediately the ships were rushed from Sala-y-Gomez,
planes carrying tons of salt took off from Australia and the
whole machinery of the World Congress was swiftly put in
operation. But it was too late; Easter Island was swamped, uninhabited
Ducie went next, and Pitcairn, home of the descendants
of the <i>Bounty</i> mutineers followed before even the
slightest precautions could be taken. The Grass was jumping
gaps of thousands of miles in a breathless steeplechase.</p>

<p>On Pitcairn there was nothing to do but rescue the inhabitants.
Vessels stood by to carry them and their livestock off.
The palebrown men and women left for the most part docilely,
but the last Adams and the last McCoy refused to go. "Once
before, our people were forced to leave Pitcairn and found
nothing but unhappiness. We will stay on the island to which
our fathers brought their wives."</p>

<p>There was no stopping the Grass now, even if the means had
been to hand. The Gambiers, the Tuamotus and the Marquesas
were swallowed up. Tahiti, dwellingplace of beautiful
if syphilitic women, disappeared under a green blanket, as did
the Cook Islands, Samoa and the Fijis. The Grass jumped
southward to a foothold in New Zealand and northward into
Micronesia. Panic infected the Australians and a mass migration
to the central part of the country was begun, but with
little hope the surrounding deserts would offer any effective
barrier.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">82.</span> <span class="num2">M</span>y first thought when I heard the
Grass for the second time had broken its bounds, was that I
had perhaps been a little hasty with Miss Francis. It was not
at all likely she would succeed where so many better trained
and better equipped scientists had so far failed, but I felt a
vicarious sympathy with her, as being out of the picture when
all her colleagues were striving with might and main to save
the world; especially after the years she had spent on Mount
Whitney. It would be an act of simple generosity on my part,
I thought, to give her the wherewithal to entertain the illusion
of importance. When all was said and done, she was a
woman, and I could afford a chivalrous gesture even in the
face of her overweening arrogance.</p>

<p>I am sorry to say she responded with complete illgrace. "I
knew youd eventually have to come crawling to me to save
your hide."</p>

<p>"You mistake the situation entirely, Miss Francis," I informed
her with dignity. "I am conferring, not asking favors. I
have every confidence in my research staff&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My God! Those guineapig murderers; those discoveryforgers;
those whitesmocked acolytes in the temple of Yes.
You value your life or your purse at exactly what theyre worth
if you expect those drugstoreclerks to preserve them for you."</p>

<p>"I doubt if either is in the slightest danger," I assured her
confidently. "Hysterics have lost perspective. Long before the
Grass becomes an immediate concern my drugstoreclerks,
with less exalted opinions of their talents than you, will have
found the means to destroy it."</p>

<p>"A soothing fairytale. Weener, the truth is not in you. You
know the reason you come to me is that youre frightened,
scared, terrified. Well, strangely enough, I'm not going to reject
your munificence. I'll accept it, because to do God's work is
more important than any personal pride of mine or any knowledge
that one of the best things <i>Cynodon dactylon</i> could do&mdash;if
I do not take too much upon myself in judging a fellowcreature&mdash;would
be to bury Albert Weener."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>I remained unmoved by her tirade. "When you returned
from Whitney you told me there remained only details to be
worked out. About how long do you think it will be before
you have a workable compound?"</p>

<p>She burst into a laugh and took out her toothpick to point
it at me. "Go and put your penny in another slot if you want
an answer to an idiot question like that. How long? A day, a
month, a year, ten years."</p>

<p>"In ten years&mdash;" I began.</p>

<p>"Exactly," she said and put away the toothpick.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">83.</span> <span class="num2">I</span> phoned Stuart Thario to fly over
right away for a conference. "General," I began, "we'll have
to start looking ahead and making plans."</p>

<p>He hid his mustache with the side of his forefinger. "Don't
quite understand, Albert&mdash;have details here of activities ...
next three years ..."</p>

<p>I pressed the buzzer for my secretary. "Bring General Thario
some refreshment," I ordered.</p>

<p>The command was not only familiar on the occasion of his
visits, but evidently anticipated, for she appeared in a moment
with a trayful of bottles.</p>

<p>"Bad habit of yours, Albert, teetotalism ... makes the
brain cloudy ... insidious." He took a long drink. "Very
little real bourbon left ... European imitation vile ...
learning to like Holland gin." He drank again.</p>

<p>"To get back to the business of making plans, General,"
I urged gently.</p>

<p>"Not one of those people getting worried about the Grass?"</p>

<p>"Not worried. Just trying to look ahead. I can't afford to be
caught napping."</p>

<p>"Well, well," he said, "can't pull another South American
this time."</p>

<p>"No, no&mdash;and besides, I'm not concerned with money."</p>

<p>"Now, Albert, don't tell me youve finally got enough."</p>

<p>"This is not the time to be avaricious," I reproved him. "If<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
the Grass continues to spread&mdash;and there seems to be little
doubt it will&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All of New Zealand's North Island was finished this morning,"
he interrupted.</p>

<p>"I heard it myself; anyway, that's the point. As the Grass
advances there will be new hordes of refugees&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was certainly in an impatient mood this morning, for he
interrupted me again. "New markets for concentrates," he
suggested.</p>

<p>I looked at him pityingly. Was the old man's mind slipping?
I wondered if it would be necessary to replace him. "General,"
I said gently, "with rare exceptions these people will have
nothing but worthless currency."</p>

<p>"Goods. Labor."</p>

<p>"Have you seen the previous batches of refugees foresighted
enough to get out any goods of value before starting off? And
as for labor, all our workers are now so heavily subsidized by
the dole that to cut wages another cent&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ha'penny," corrected General Thario.</p>

<p>"Centime if you like. &mdash;would be merely to increase our
taxes."</p>

<p>"Well, well," he said. "I see I have been hasty. What did you
have in mind, Albert?"</p>

<p>"Retrenchment. Cut production; abandon the factories in
the immediate path of the Grass. Fix on reasonably safe spots
to store depots of the finished concentrates, others for raw
materials. Or perhaps they might be combined."</p>

<p>"What about the factories?"</p>

<p>"Smaller," I said. "Practically portable."</p>

<p>"Hum." He frowned. "You do intend to do business on a
small scale."</p>

<p>"Minute," I confirmed.</p>

<p>"What about the mines? The steelmills, the oilfields, the
airplane and automobile factories? The shipyards?"</p>

<p>"Shut them down," I ordered. "Ruthlessly. Except maybe a
few in England."</p>

<p>"The countries where theyre located will grab them."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>"There isnt a government in existence who would dare
touch anything belonging to Consolidated Pemmican. If any
should come into existence our individualistic friends would
take care of the situation."</p>

<p>"Pay gangsters to overturn governments?"</p>

<p>"They would hardly be legitimate governments. Anyway,
a man has a right to protect his property."</p>

<p>"Albert," he complained querulously, "youre condemning
civilization to death."</p>

<p>"General," I said, "youre talking like a wildeyed crackpot.
A businessman's concern is with business; he leaves abstractions
to visionaries. Our plants will be closed down, because
until the Grass is stopped they can make us no profit. Let some
idealistic industrialist take care of civilization."</p>

<p>"Albert, you know very well no business of any size can operate
today without your active support. Think again, Albert;
listen to me as a friend; we have been associated a long time
and to some extent you have taken Joe's place in my mind.
Consider the larger aspects. Suppose you don't make a profit?
Suppose you even take a loss. You can afford to do it for common
humanity."</p>

<p>"I certainly think I do my share for common humanity,
General Thario, and it cuts me to the heart that you of all
people should imply such a sentimental and unjust reproach
against me. You know as well as I do I have given more than
half my fortune to charitable works."</p>

<p>"Albert, Albert, need there be this hypocrisy between you
and me?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean. I only know I called you to
evolve specific plans and you have embarked instead on windy
platitudes and personal insult."</p>

<p>He sat for a long time quietly, his drink untouched before
him. I did not disturb his meditation, but indulged in one on
my own account, thinking of all I had done for him and his
family. But only a foolish man expects gratitude, or for that
matter any reward at all for his kindnesses.</p>

<p>At last he broke his silence, speaking slowly, almost painfully.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
"I have not had what could be called a successful life,
even though today I am a wealthy man." He resumed his drink
again and I wondered what this remark had to do with the
subject in hand. Perhaps nothing, I thought; he is just rambling
along while he reconciles himself to the situation. I was
glad he was going to be sensible afterall. Not that it mattered;
I could get many able lieutenants, but for oldtime's sake I was
pleased at the abandonment of his recalcitrance. He relaxed
further into the chair while I waited to resume the practical
discussion.</p>

<p>"When you first came to me in Washington, Albert, seeking
warcontracts for your microscopic business, I suppose there
was even then a mark upon your forehead, but I was too heavy
with the guilt of my own affairs to see it. We all have our price,
Albert, sometimes it is another star on the shoulderstraps or a
peerage or wealth or the apparent safety of a son....</p>

<p>"I have come a long way with you since then, Albert,
through shady deals and brilliant coups and dark passages
which would not bear too much investigation. I'm afraid I
cannot go any further with you. You will have to get someone
else to kill civilization."</p>

<p>"As you choose, General Thario," I agreed stiffly.</p>

<p>"Wait, I'm not finished. I have always tried, however inadequately,
to do my duty. Articles of War ... holding commission
in the Armies of the United States...." Emotion seemed
to be sobering him rapidly. "Duty to you ... Consolidated
Pemmican ... resign commission. Must mention spot ...
try Sahara...."</p>

<p>He stood up.</p>

<p>"Thank you, General Thario," I said. "I shall certainly consider
the Sahara as location for depots."</p>

<p>"You won't change your mind about this whole thing,
Albert?"</p>

<p>I shook my head. How could I fly in the face of commonsense
to gratify the silly whim of an old man whose intelligence was
clearly not what it had once been?</p>

<p>"I was afraid not," he muttered, "afraid not. I don't blame<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
you, Albert. Men are as God created them ... or environment,
as the socialist fellers say ... you didnt put the mark
on your forehead ... Not successful ... Joe (I called him
George but he was Joe all the time) wanted to go to West Point
afterall ... First Symphony in the fire ... <i>I</i> burned Joe's
First Symphony ... Do you understand me, Albert? Though
I refuse, I am still guilty ... Cannibal Thario, they said
... Chronos would be better ... classical allusion escapes
the enlistedman...."</p>

<p>He walked out, still mumbling inarticulately and I sat there
saddened that a man once alert and vigorous as the general
should have come at last to senility and an enfeebled mind.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">84.</span> <span class="num2">T</span>he defection of General Thario
threw a great burden of work upon my shoulders. Preblesham
was able enough in his own sphere, but his vision was not sufficiently
broad to operate at the highest levels. The process of
closing down our plants was more complicated than had been
anticipated and Thario's military mind would have been more
useful than Preblesham's theological one. The employees, conceiving
through some fantastic logic that their jobs were as
much their property as the mills or mines or factorybuildings
were mine, rioted and had to be pacified&mdash;the first time such a
tactic was resorted to in years. In some places these misguided
men actually took possession of the places where they worked
and tried to operate them, but of course they were balked by
their own inefficiency. Human nature being what it is, they
tried to blame their helplessness on my control of their sources
of raw material and their consequent inability to obtain vital
supplies; as well as the cutting off of light and power from the
seized plants, but this was mere buckpassing, always noticeable
when some radical scheme fails.</p>

<p>But the setting up of depots in the Sahara, as General
Thario had suggested, and by extension, in Arabia, was a different
matter. Here Preblesham's genius shone. He flew our
whole Australian store of raw materials out without a loss. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
recruited gangs of Chinese coolies with an efficiency which
would have put an oldtime blackbirder to shame. He argued,
cajoled, bullied, sweated for twentyfour hours a day and when
in six months he had completed his task, we had seven depots,
two in Arabia and five in Africa, complete with four factories,
with enough concentrates on hand to feed the world for a
year&mdash;if the world had the means to pay, which it didnt&mdash;and
to operate for five.</p>

<p>During those six months the Grass ravenously snatched
morsel after morsel. New Zealand's South Island, New Caledonia,
the Solomons and the Marianas were gobbled at the
same moment. It gorged on New Guinea and searched out the
minor islands of the East Indies as a cat searches for baby fieldmice
in a nest her paw has discovered. It took a bite of the
Queensland coast just below the Great Barrier Reef. The next
day it was reported near Townsville and soon after on the
Cape York peninsula, the Australian finger pointing upward
to islands where lived little black men with woolly hair.</p>

<p>The people of Melbourne and Sydney and Brisbane took
the coming of the Grass with calm anger. Preparations for
removal had been made months before and this migration was
distinguished from previous ones by its order and completeness.
But although they moved calmly in accordance with clear
plans their anger was directed against all those in authority
who had failed to take measures to protect their beloved land.</p>

<p>Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania
went. The Grass swept southward like a sickle, cutting through
South Australia and biting deep with its point into Western.
Although we were amply provided with raw material, considering
the curtailment of our activities, Preblesham, on the
spot, could not resist buying up great herds of sheep for a
penny on the pound and having them driven northward in the
hope of finding somehow a means to ship them. I am sorry to
say&mdash;though I'm afraid I could have predicted it&mdash;this venture
was a total loss.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">85.</span> <span class="num2">B</span>urlet, unfolding the <i>Times</i> on my
breakfastplate, coughed respectfully. "If I could speak to you
at your convenience, sir?"</p>

<p>"What is it, Burlet? Lord Arpers finally come through with
a higher offer?"</p>

<p>"Not at all, sir. I consider the question of service closed as
long as you find yourself satisfied, sir."</p>

<p>"Quite satisfied, Burlet."</p>

<p>"I ad in mind the discussion of quite another matter, sir.
Not relating to domestic issues."</p>

<p>"Very well, Burlet. Come into the library after breakfast."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir."</p>

<p>With a world of problems on my mind I thought it would
be wryly amusing to resolve whatever difficulties troubled my
butler. Promptly after I had settled myself at my desk and
before I rang for my secretary, Burlet appeared in the doorway,
his striped vest smoothed down over his rounded abdomen,
every thin hair in place over the dome of his balding
head.</p>

<p>"Come in, Burlet. Sit down. What's on your mind?"</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir." To my surprise he accepted my invitation
and seated himself opposite me. "I ave been speculating, sir."</p>

<p>"Really, Burlet? Silly thing to do. Lost all your wages, I
suppose, and would like an advance?"</p>

<p>"You misappre&mdash;end me, sir. Not speculating on Change.
Speculating on the Grass."</p>

<p>"Oh. And did you arrive at any conclusion, Burlet?"</p>

<p>"I believe I ave, sir. As I understand it, scientists and statesmen
are exerting their energies to fight the Grass."</p>

<p>"That's right." I was beginning to be bored. Had the butler
fallen prey to one of the graminophile sects like Brother Paul's
and gone through all this rigmarole merely to give me notice
previous to immolating himself?</p>

<p>"And so far they ave achieved no success?"</p>

<p>"Obviously, Burlet."</p>

<p>"Well then, sir, would it not be a sensible precaution to find<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
some means of refuge until and if they find a way to kill the
Grass?"</p>

<p>"There is no 'if,' Burlet. The means will be found, and
shortly&mdash;of that I am sure. As for temporary refuge until that
time, no doubt it would be excellent, if practicable. What do
you propose&mdash;emigration to Mars or floating islands in the
oceans?" Both of these expedients had long ago been put forth
by contestants in the <i>Intelligencer</i>.</p>

<p>"Journeys to other planets would not solve things, sir. Assuming
the construction of a vessel&mdash;an assumption so far
unwarranted, if I may say so, sir&mdash;it would accommodate but
a fraction of the affected populations. As for floating islands,
they would be no more immune to airborne seeds than stationary
ones."</p>

<p>"So it was discovered long ago, Burlet."</p>

<p>"Quite so, sir. Then, if I may say so, protection must be
afforded on the spot."</p>

<p>"And how do you propose to do that?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, by the building of vertical cities."</p>

<p>"Vertical cities?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I believe sites should be selected near bodies of
fresh water and tremendous excavations made. The walls and
floor of the excavations should be lined with concrete, through
which the water is piped. The cities could be on many levels,
the topmost peraps several miles in the air&mdash;glass enclosed&mdash;and
with pipes reaching still igher to bring air in, and completely
tight against the Grass. They should be selfcontained,
generating their own power and providing their food by ydroponic
farming. Such cities could hold millions of people now
doomed until a way is found to kill the Grass."</p>

<p>There was a faintly familiar ring to the scheme.</p>

<p>"You seem to have worked it out thoroughly, Burlet."</p>

<p>"Polishing the plate, sir."</p>

<p>"Polishing the plate?"</p>

<p>"It leaves the mind free for cerebration. I ave a full set of
blueprints and specifications, if youd like to inspect them, sir."</p>

<p>It was fantastic, I thought, and probably quite impractical,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
but I promised to submit his plans to those with more technical
knowledge than I possessed. I sent his carefully written
papers to an undersecretary of the World Congress and forgot
the matter. Idleness certainly led to queer occupations. Vertical
cities&mdash;and who in the world had the money to erect these
nightmare structures? Only Albert Weener&mdash;that was probably
why Burlet took advantage of his position to approach me with
the scheme. Completely absurd....</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">86.</span> <span class="num2">P</span>robably the complaints of the Australians
gave final impetus to the Congress to Combat the
Grass. They met in extraordinary session in Budapest and
declared themselves the executive body of a world government,
which did not of course include the Socialist Union. All
qualified scientists were immediately ordered to leave whatever
employment they had and place themselves at the disposition
of the World Government. Affluence for life, guaranteed
against any fluctuations of currency, was promised to anyone
who could offer, not necessarily an answer, but an idea which
should lead to the solution of the problem in hand. While they
were issuing their first edicts the Grass finished off the East
Indies, covered threequarters of Australia and attacked the
southern Philippines.</p>

<p>Millions of Indonesians traveling the comparatively short
distances in anything floatable crowded the already overpopulated
areas of Asia. As I had predicted to General Thario, these
refugees carried nothing with which to purchase the concentrates
to keep them alive, and conditions of famine in India
and China, essentially due to the backwardness of these countries,
offered no subsistence to the natives&mdash;much less to an
influx from outside.</p>

<p>The Grass sped northward and westward through the Malay
States and Siam, up into China and Burma. In the beginning
the Orientals did not flee, but stood their ground, village by
village and family by family, opposing the advance with
scythes, stones, and pitiful bonfires of their household belongings,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
with hoes, flails, and finally with their bare hands. But
the naked hand, no matter how often multiplied, was as unable
to halt the green flow as the most uptodate weapons of
modern science. And the Chinese and the Hindus dying at
their posts were no more an obstacle than mountain or desert
or stretches of empty sea had been.</p>

<p>It was now deemed expedient, in order to keep public hysteria
from rising to new selfdestructive heights, to tone down
and modify the news. This proved quite difficult at first, for
the people in their shortsightedness clamored for the accounts
of impending doom which they devoured with a dreadful fascination.
But eventually, when the wildest rumors produced
by the dearth of accurate reports were disproved, many of the
people in Western Europe and Africa actually believed the
Grass had somehow failed to make headway on the Asiatic
continent and would have remained in their pleasant ignorance
had it not been for the premature flight of masses of
Asiatics.</p>

<p>For the phenomenon contemporary with the close of the
Roman Empire was repeated. A great, struggling, churning,
sprawling, desperate efflux from east to west began; once more
the Golden Horde was on the march. They did not come, as
had their ancestors, on wildly charging horses, threatening
with lances and deadly scimitars, but on foot, wretched and
begging. Even had I been as maudlin as Stuart Thario desired
I could not have fed these people, for there were no longer
railroads with rollingstock adequate to carry the freight, no
fleets of trucks in good repair, nor was the fuel available had
they existed. The world receded rapidly from the machineage,
and as it did so famine and pestilence increased in evermounting
spirals.</p>

<p>The mob of refugees might be likened to a beast with weak,
almost atrophied legs, but with a great mouth and greater
stomach. It moved with painful slowness, crawling over the
face of southern Asia, finding little sustenance as it came, leaving
none whatever after it left. The beast, only dimly aware of
the Grass it was fleeing from, could formulate no thoughts of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
the refuge it sought. Without plan, hope, or malice, it was
concerned only with hunger. Day and night its empty gut cried
for food.</p>

<p>The starving men and women&mdash;the children died quickly&mdash;ate
first all that was available in the stores and homes, then
scrabbled in the fields for a forgotten grain of rice or wheat;
they ate the bark and fungus from the trees and gleaned the
pastures of their weeds and dung. As they ate they moved on,
their faminedistended stomachs craving more to eat, driving
the ones who were but one step further from starvation ever
before them.</p>

<p>Long ago they had chewed on the leather of their footgear
and devoured all cats, dogs and rodents. They ate the stiffened
and putrid carcasses of draft animals which had been pushed
to the last extremity; they turned upon the corpses of the newly
dead and fed on them, and at length did not wait for death
from hunger to make a new cadaver, but mercifully slew the
weak and ate the still warm bodies.</p>

<p>The Asiatic influx was a social accordion. The pulledout
end, the high notes, as it were, the Indian princes, Chinese warlords,
arrived quickly and settled into a welcoming obscurity.
They came by plane, with gold and jewels and government
bonds and shares of Consolidated Pemmican. The middle
creases of the accordion came later, more slowly, but as quickly
as money could speed their way. Men of wealth when they began
their journey, they arrived little more than penniless and
were looked upon with suspicion, tolerated only so long as they
did not become a public charge.</p>

<p>The low notes, the thick and heavy pleats, took not days nor
weeks nor months, but years to make the trek. They kept but
a step ahead of the Grass, traveling at the same pace. They
came not alone, but with accretions, pushing ahead of them
millions of their same dispossessed, hungry, penniless kind.
These were not greeted with suspicion, but with hatred; machineguns
were turned upon the advancing mobs, the few airplanes
in service were commandeered to bomb them, and only
lack of fuel and explosives allowed them to sweep into Europe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
and overwhelm most of it as the barbarians had overwhelmed
Rome.</p>

<p>But I anticipate. While the bulk of the Orientals was still
beyond the Himalayas and the Gobi, Europe indulged in a
wild saturnalia to celebrate its own doom. All pretense of sexual
morality vanished. Men and women coupled openly upon
the streets. The small illprinted newspapers carried advertisements
promising the gratification of strange lusts. A new cult
of Priapus sprang up and virgins were ceremoniously deflowered
at his shrine. Those beyond the age of concupiscence
attended celebrations of the Black Mass, although I was told
by one communicant that participation lacked the necessary
zest, since none possessed a faith to which blasphemy could
give a shocking thrill.</p>

<p>Murder was indulged in purely for the pleasure. Men and
women, hearing of the cannibalism raging among the refugees,
adopted and refined it for their own amusement. Small promiscuous
groups, at the end of orgies, chose the man and woman
tiring soonest; the two victims were thereupon killed and
devoured by their late paramours.</p>

<p>As there was a cult to Priapus, so there was an equally strong
cult to Diana. The monasteries and convents overflowed. But
in the tension of the moment many were not satisfied with
mere vows of celibacy. In secret and impressive ceremonies
women scarified their tenderest parts with redhot irons, thus
proving themselves forever beyond the lusts of the flesh; men
solemnly castrated themselves and threw the symbols of their
manhood into a consuming fire.</p>

<p>I wouldnt want to give the impression bestial madness of
one kind or another overtook everyone. There were plenty
of normal people like myself who were able to maintain their
selfcontrol and canalize those energies promoting crimes and
beastly exhibitions in the unrestrained into looking forward to
the day when the Grass would be gone and sanity return.</p>

<p>Nor would I like anyone to think law and order had completely
abdicated its function. As offenses multiplied, laws
grew more severe, misdemeanors became felonies, felonies<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
capital offenses. When death by hanging became the prescribed
sentence for any type of theft it was necessary to make the
punishment for murder more drastic. Drawing and quartering
were reinstituted; this not proving an efficient deterrent, many
jurists advocated a return to the Roman practice of spreadeagling
a man to death; but the churches vigorously objected
to this suggestion as blasphemous, believing the ordinary sight
of crucified murderers would tend to debase the central symbol
of Christianity. A less common Roman usage was adopted
in its stead, that of being torn by hungry dogs, and to this the
Christians did not object.</p>

<p>But the utmost severity of local and national officials, even
when backed by the might of World Government, could not
cope with the waves of migrants from the East nor the heedlessness
of law they brought with them. As the Grass pushed
the Indians and Chinese westward, they in turn sent the Mongols,
the Afghans and the Persians ahead of them. These naturally
warlike peoples were displaced, not by force of arms, but
by sheer weight of numbers; and so, doubly overcome by being
dispossessed of their homes&mdash;and by pacifists at that&mdash;they
vented their pique upon those to the west.</p>

<p>As the starving and destitute trickled into Europe and North
Africa, giving a hint of the flood to follow, I congratulated
myself on the foresight which led to our retrenchment, for I
know these ravening hordes would have devoured the property
of Consolidated Pemmican with as little respect as they did
the scant store of Ah Que, Ram Singh or Mohammed Ali. My
chief concern was now to keep my industrial and organizational
machinery intact against the day when a stable market
could again be established. To this end I kept our vast staff of
researchworkers&mdash;exempt from the draft of the World Government
which had been quite reasonable in the matter&mdash;constantly
busy, for every day's delay in the arresting of the Grass
meant a dead loss of profits.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">87.</span> <span class="num2">J</span>osephine Francis alone, and as always,
proved completely uncooperative. Undoubtedly much
of her stubbornness was due to her sex; the residue, to her
unorthodox approach to the mysteries of science. When I
prodded her for results she snarled she was not a slotmachine.
When I pointed out tactfully that only my money made possible
the continuation of her efforts, she told me rudely to
seek the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem before it was covered by
the Grass. Again and again I urged her to give me some idea
how long it would be before she could produce a chemical
even for experimental use against the Grass and each time she
turned me aside with insult or rude jest.</p>

<p>I had set her up in&mdash;or rather, to be more accurate, she had
insisted upon&mdash;a completely equipped and isolated laboratory
in Surrey. As it was convenient to my Hampshire place I
dropped in almost daily upon her; but I cannot say my visits
perceptibly quickened her lethargy.</p>

<p>"Worried, Weener?" she asked me, absently putting down
a coffeepot on a stack of microscope slides. "<i>Cynodon dactylon</i>'ll
eat gold and banknotes, drillpresses and openhearths as
readily as quartz and mica, dead bodies and abandoned household
goods."</p>

<p>I couldnt resist the opening. "Anything in fact," I pointed
out, "except salt."</p>

<p>"A Daniel!" she exclaimed. "A Daniel come to judgment.
Oh, Weener, thou shouldst have been born a chemist. And
what is the other mistake? Give me leave to throw away my
retorts and testtubes and bunsen burners by revealing the
other element besides sodium <i>Cynodon dactylon</i> refuses. For
every mistake there is another mistake which supplements it.
Sodium was the blindspot in the Metamorphizer; when I find
the balancing blindspot I shall know not only the second
element which the Grass cannot absorb but one which will be
poison to it."</p>

<p>"I'm not a chemist, Miss Francis," I said, "but it seems to me
Ive heard there are a limited number of elements."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>

<p>"There are. And three states for each element. And an infinite
number of conditions governing their application.
What's the matter&mdash;arent your trained seals performing?"</p>

<p>"All the research laboratories of Consolidated Pemmican
are going night and day."</p>

<p>"Then what the devil are you hounding me for? Let them
find the counteragent."</p>

<p>"Two heads are better than one."</p>

<p>"Nonsense. Two blockheads are worse than one insofar as
they tend to regard each other as a source of wisdom. I shall
conquer the Grass, I alone, I, Josephine Spencer Francis&mdash;and
as soon as possible. Now you have all the data in its most specific
form. And I shall accomplish this because I must and not
because I love Albert Weener or care a litmuspaper whether
or not his offal is swallowed up. I have done what I have done
(God forgive me) and I shall undo it, but the matter is between
me and a Larger Accountant than the clerk who signs
your monthly checks."</p>

<p>"What do you think about temporary protective measures
in the meanwhile?"</p>

<p>"What the devil do you mean, Weener? 'Temporary protective
measures'? What euphuistic gibberish is this?"</p>

<p>I outlined briefly my butler's plan of vertical cities. Miss
Francis startled me with a laugh resembling the burst of machinegun
fire. "Someone's been pulling your leg, poor terrified
Maecenas. Or else youre befuddled with too many <i>Thrilling
Wonder Scientifictions</i>. Pipes into the stratosphere! Watersupply
piped in through concrete walls! Doesnt your mad inventor
know the seeds would find these apertures in an instant?"</p>

<p>"Oh, those are possibly minor flaws which could be remedied."</p>

<p>"Well, go and remedy them and leave me to my work. Or
pin your faith on substantialities instead of flights of fancy."</p>

<p>I went up to London, my mind full of a thousand problems.
I had caught the economical British habit of using the trains,
conserving the petrol and tyres on my car. The first thing I saw
on the Marylebone platform was the crude picture in green<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
chalk of a stolon of <i>Cynodon dactylon</i>. What idiot, I thought
as I irritably rubbed at it with the sole of my shoe, what feebleminded
creature has been let loose to do a thing like this?
The brittle chalk smeared beneath my foot, but the representation
remained, almost recognizable. On my way to the Savoy
I saw it again, defacing a hoarding, and as I paid off my driver
I thought I caught another glimpse of the nonsensical drawing
on the side of a lorry going by.</p>

<p>Perhaps my sensitivity perceived these signs before they
were common property, but in a few days they were spread all
over Europe, through what insane impulse I do not know. For
whatever reason, symbols of the Grass blossomed on the Arc de
Triomphe, on the Brandenburger Tor, on the pavement of the
Ringstrasse and on the bridges spanning the Danube between
Buda and Pesth.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">88.</span> <span class="num2">I</span> find myself, in retrospect, involuntarily
telescoping the time of events. Looking backward, years
become days, and months minutes. At the time I saw the first
reproductions of the Grass in London the thing itself was
continents away, busy absorbing the fringes of Asia. But its
heralds and victims went before it, changing the life of man
as it had itself changed the face of the world.</p>

<p>The breakdown of civilization beyond the Channel was
almost complete. Only Consolidated Pemmican and the
World Government still maintained communication facilities;
and with the blocking of the normal ways of commerce the
World Government found it difficult to spread either news or
decrees to the general public. The most fantastic and contradictory
ideas about the Grass were held by the masses.</p>

<p>When the Grass was in the Deccan and still well below the
Yangtze, the Athenians were thrown into panic by the rumor
it had appeared in Salonika. At the same time there was wild
rejoicing in the streets of Marseilles based on the belief large
stretches of North America had become miraculously free.
The cult of the Grass idolaters flourished despite the strictest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
interdictions and great massmeetings were frequently held
during which the worshipers turned their faces toward the
southeast and prayed fervently for speedy immolation. It was
quite useless for the World Government to attempt to spread
the actual facts; the earlier censorship together with a public
temper that preferred to believe the extremes of good or bad
rather than the truth of gradual yet relentless approach, made
people heedless of broadcasts rarely received even by state
operated publicaddress systems or of handbills which even the
still literate could not bother to decipher.</p>

<p>The idealization of the Socialist Union&mdash;once the Soviet
Union&mdash;which had risen and fallen through the years, was
quickened among those not enamored of the Grass. There
must be some intrinsic virtue in this land which had not only
been immune to inoculation by the Metamorphizer, but kept
the encroaching weed from invading its borders in spite of its
long continued proximity across Bering Strait and the Aleutians.
The Grass had jumped gaps thousands of ocean miles
and yet it had not bridged that narrow strip of water. It would
have been a shock to these people had they known, as I knew
and as the World Government had vainly tried to tell them,
what Moscow had recently and reluctantly admitted: the Grass
had long since crossed into Siberia and was now working its
will from Kamchatka to the Lena River.</p>

<p>The people of Japan, caught between the jaws of a closing
vise, responded in a manner peculiar to themselves. The Christians,
now forming a majority, declared the Grass a punishment
for the sins of the world and hoped, by their steadfastness
in the face of certain death, to earn a national martyr's
crown and thus perhaps redeem those still benighted. The
Shintoists, on the other hand, agreed the Grass was a punishment&mdash;but
for a different crime. Had the doctrine of the Eight
Corners of the World never been abandoned the Japanese
would never have permitted the Grass to overwhelm the Yamato
race. The new emperor's reign name, Saiji, they argued,
ought not to mean rule by the people as it was usually interpreted,
but rule of the people and they called for an immediate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
Saiji Restoration, under which the subjects of the Mikado
would welcome death on the battlefield in a manner compatible
with bushido, thus redeeming previous aberrations for
which they were now being chastised. Both parties agreed that
under no circumstances would any Japanese demean himself
by leaving Nippon and the world was therefore spared an additional
influx from these islands.</p>

<p>But the Japanese were the only ones who refused to join the
westward stampede plunging the world daily deeper into barbarism.
We in England had cause to congratulate ourselves on
our unique position. The Channel might have been a thousand
miles wide instead of twenty. The turmoil of the Continent
and of Africa was but dimly reflected. There was still a
skeletal vestige of trade, the dole kept the lazy from starvation,
railways still functioned on greatly reduced schedules, and the
wireless continued to operate from, "Good morning, everybody,
this is London," to the last strains of <i>God Save the
Queen</i>. Although I was constantly rasped by inactivity and by
the slowness of the researchworkers to find a weapon against
the Grass, I was happy to be able to wait out this terrible period
in so ameliorative a spot.</p>

<p>True, our depots in the Arabian and Sahara deserts were
unthreatened by either the Grass or the horde, but I should
have found it uncomfortable indeed to have lived in either
place. In Hampshire or London I felt myself the center of what
was left of the world, ready to jump into action the moment
the great discovery was finally made and the Grass began to
recede.</p>

<p>Preblesham, my right hand, flew weekly to Africa and Asia
Minor, weeding out those workers who threatened to become
useless to us because of their reaction to the isolated and monotonous
conditions at the depots; keeping the heavily armed
guards about our closed continental properties alert and seeing
our curtailed activities in Great Britain were judiciously
profitable. This period of quiescence suited his talents perfectly,
for it required of him little imagination, but great
industry and force.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<p>I had noticed for some time a slight air of preoccupation and
constraint in his demeanor during his reports to me, but I put
it down to his engrossment with our affairs and resolved to
make him take an extended vacation as soon as he could be
spared, never dreaming of disloyalty from him.</p>

<p>I was shocked, then, and deeply wounded when at the close
of one of our conferences he announced, "Mr Weener, I'm
leaving you."</p>

<p>I begged him to tell me what was wrong, what had caused
him to come to this decision. I knew, I said, that he was overworked
and offered him the badly needed vacation. He shook
his head.</p>

<p>"It aint that. Overwork! I don't believe there is such a thing.
At least Ive never suffered from it. No, Mr Weener, my trouble
is something no amount of vacations can help, because I can't
get away from a Voice."</p>

<p>"Voice, Tony?" Hallucinations were certainly a symptom
of overwork. I began mentally recalling names of prominent
psychiatrists.</p>

<p>"A Voice within," he repeated firmly. "I am a sinful man,
a miserable backslider. Maybe Brother Paul was not treading a
true path; I doubt if he was or I would not have been led aside
from following him so easily; but when I was doing his work
I was at least trying to do the will of God and not the will
of another man no better&mdash;spiritually, you understand, Mr
Weener, spiritually&mdash;than myself.</p>

<p>"But now His Voice has sought me out again and I must
once more take up the cross. I feel a call to go on a mission to
the poor heathens and urge on them submission to their
Father's rod."</p>

<p>"Among those savages across the Channel! They will tear
you limb from limb."</p>

<p>"Christ will make me whole again."</p>

<p>"Tony, you are not yourself. Youre upset."</p>

<p>"I am not myself, Mr Weener, I have become as a little child
again and do my Father's bidding. I am upset, yes, turned
upsidedown and insideout by a Force not content to leave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
men in wrong attitudes or sinful states. But upset, I stand
upright and go about my Father's business. God bless you,
Mr Weener."</p>

<p>Miss Francis and Preblesham, at opposite ends of the intellectual
scale, both maundering on about doing the Will of
God and General Thario talking about marks on foreheads&mdash;what
sort of feebleminded, retrogressive world was I living in?
All the outworn superstitions of religion taking hold of people
and intruding themselves into otherwise normal conversation.
A wave of madness, akin to the plague of the Grass,
must be sweeping over the earth, was my conclusion.</p>

<p>If General Thario's desertion had thrown an extra weight
on my shoulders, Preblesham's burdened me with all the petty
details of routine. It was now I who had to inspect our depots
periodically and make constant trips into the dangerous regions
across the Channel to see that the shutdown plants were
being properly cared for. I resented bitterly the trick of fate
preventing me from finding for any length of time subordinates
to whom I could delegate authority.</p>

<p>Nor even on whom I could rely. What were Miss Francis
and her wellpaid staff doing all this time? Why had they produced
nothing in return for the fat living they got from me?
The Grass was halfway across Asia, lapping the High Pamirs
from the south and from the north, digesting Korea, Manchuria,
Mongolia, thrusting runners into Turkestan&mdash;and still
no progress made against it. It would be a matter of mere
months now until our Arabian depots would be in the danger
zone. I could only conclude these socalled scientists were little
better than fakers, completely incompetent when confronted
by emergency.</p>

<p>They were ready enough to announce useless and inapplicable
discoveries and conclusions; byproducts of their research,
they called them, with an obviously selfconscious attempt to
speak the language of industry. The insects living in and below
the Grass were growing ever larger and more numerous.
Expeditions had found worms the size of snakes and bugs big
as birds, happy in their environment. The oceans, they announced,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
were drying up, due to the retention of moisture in
the soil by the Grass, and added complacently that in a million
years or so, assuming the Grass in the meantime covered the
earth, there would be no bodies of water left. Climates were
equalizing themselves, the polar icecaps were melting and
spots previously too cold for <i>Cynodon dactylon</i> were now covered.
I felt it to be a clear case of embezzlement that they had
used my money, paid for a specific purpose, to make these useless,
if possibly interesting, deductions.</p>

<p>For while they dawdled and read learned papers to each
other, the Grass touched the Persian Gulf and the Caspian,
paused before Lake Balkash and reached the Yenisei at the
Arctic Circle. Far to the south it jumped from India to the
Maldives, from the Maldives to the Seychelles and from
the Seychelles on to the great island of Madagascar. I hammered
the theme of "Time, time" at Miss Francis, but her only
response was a helpless sneer at my impatience.</p>

<p>At intervals Burlet inquired of me what progress was being
made with his plan for cities of refuge. I could only answer
him truthfully that as far as I knew the World Government
had it under consideration.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;if you will excuse my saying so, sir&mdash;in the meantime
those people are dying."</p>

<p>"Quite so, Burlet, but there is nothing you or I can do
about it."</p>

<p>For the first time since he entered my service I caught him
looking almost impertinently at me. I faced him back and he
dropped his eyes. "Very good, sir. Thank you."</p>

<p>He had made an understatement when he talked about
"those people" dying. Europe was a madhouse. In selfdefense
all strangers were instantly put to death and in retaliation the
invading throngs spared no native. Peasants feared to stay their
ground in terror of the oncoming Orientals and equally dared
not move westward where certain killing awaited them at the
hands of those who yesterday had been their neighbors. In an
effort to cling to life they formed small bands and fought impartially
both the static and dynamic forces. Farming was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
practically abandoned and the swollen population lived entirely
on wild growth or upon human flesh.</p>

<p>In Africa the situation was little better. Internecine wars
and slavery made their reappearance; the South African whites
mercilessly slaughtered the blacks against a possible uprising
and the Kaffirs, fleeing northward, repeated the European pattern
of overcrowding, famine and pestilence.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">89.</span> <span class="num2">T</span>he day our Arabian depots were
abandoned before the oncoming Grass I felt my heart would
nearly break with anguish. All that labor, all that forethought,
all those precious goods gone. And all because Miss Francis
and those like her were too lazy or incompetent to do the work
for which they were paid. I flew to the spot, trying vainly to
salvage something, but lack of planes and fuel made it impossible.
During this trip I caught my first sight of the Grass for
years.</p>

<p>I suppose no human eye sees anything abstractly, but only
in relation to other things known and observed. With more
than half the world in its grip, the towering wave of green
bore no more resemblance to its California prototype than a
brontosaurus to the harmless lizard scuttling over the sunny
floor of an outhouse. Between the dirtysugar sands of the desert
and the oleograph sky it was a third band of brilliant color,
monstrously outofplace. A tidalwave would have seemed less
alien and awful.</p>

<p>The distance was great enough so that no individual part
stood out distinctly; instead, it presented itself as a flat belt
of green, menacing and obdurate. As my plane rose I looked
back at it stretching northward, southward and eastward to
the horizon, a new invader in a land weary of many invaders;
and I thought of the dead civilizations it covered: Bactria,
Parthia, Babylon; the Empire of Lame Timur, Cathay, Cambodia,
and the dominions of the Great Mogul.</p>

<p>The refuge of mankind narrowed continually, an island
diminished daily by a lapping surf. Africa was thrice beset, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
the south from Madagascar; in the center from the steppingstones
in the Indian Ocean, and across the Red Sea where the
Grass sucked renewed life from the steaming jungles and grew
with unbelievable rapidity; in the highlands of Rhodesia and
Abyssinia it crept slowly over the plateaus toward the slopes of
Kilimanjaro and the Drakensberg. Unless something were
done quickly our Sahara depots would go the way of the Arabian
ones and we would be left with only our limited British
facilities until the day when Africa and Asia would be reconquered.</p>

<p>The violence and murder which had gone before were tame
compared with the new fury that shook the feartortured people
of Europe, helpless in the nightmareridden days, dreaming
through twitching nights of an escape geographically nonexistent.
Dismembered corpses in the streets, arenas packed with
dead bodies, fallow fields newly fertilized with human blood
added their stench to that of an unwashed, disease riddled
continent. A rumor was circulated that there were still Jews
alive and those who but yesterday had sought each other in
mortal combat now happily united to hunt down a common
prey. And sure enough, in miserable caverns and cellars hitherto
overlooked, shunning daylight, a few men in skullcaps
and prayingshawls were found, dragged out into the disinterested
sunlight with their families and exterminated. It was at
this time the Grass crossed the Urals and leaped the Atlantic
into Iceland.</p>

<p>In England, George Bernard Shaw, whose reported death
some years before had been mourned by those who had never
read a word of his, rose apparently from the grave to deliver
himself of a last message:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"If any who wept over my senile and useless carcass had
taken the trouble to read <i>Back to Methuselah</i>, they could have
reassured themselves regarding my premature demise. If ever
there was to be a Longliver, that Longliver would have to be
me. This was determined by the Life Force in the middle of
the XIX Century. That Life Force could not afford to rob a
squinting world of a man of perfect vision.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>

<p>"Like Haslam (I forget his first name&mdash;see my complete
works if you're interested) I gave myself out as dead in order
to avoid the gawking of a curious and idle multitude. I was
recuperating from the labors of my first century in order to
throw myself into the more arduous ones of the second.</p>

<p>"But as I have pointed out so many times, the race was between
maturity and the petulant self-destruction of protracted
adolescence. Mankind had either to take thought or to perish,
and it has chosen (perhaps sensibly after all) to perish. I am
too old now to protest against selfindulgence.</p>

<p class="nmp">"Is it too late? Is it still possible to survive? The ship is now
indeed upon the rocks and the skipper in his bunk below
drinking bottled ditchwater. But perhaps a Captain Shotover,
drunk on the milk of human kindness rather than rum, will
emerge upon the quarterdeck and, blowing his whistle, call
all hands on deck before the last rending crash. In that unlikely

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">90.</span> <span class="num2">I</span>n spite of the anarchic and unspeakable
conditions on the Continent, I could not refrain from
making one last tour of inspection. The thought of flooded
mines, pillaged factories and gutted mills was more than I
could bear. The stocks of oil in England were running short,
but I commanded enough to fill my great transportplane. We
flew low over roads crawling with humanity as a sick animal
crawls with vermin. Some cities were empty, obscenely bereft
of population; others choked with wanderers.</p>

<p>The Ruhr was a valley filled with the dead, with men tearing
each other's throats in a frenzy of hunger, with the unburied
and the soon to be buried sleeping sidebyside through
restless nights. Not a building was still whole; what had not
been torn down in pointless rage had been razed by reasonless
arson. Not one brick of the great openhearths had been left in
place, not one girder of the great sheds remained erect.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>

<p>The Saar was in little better case and the mines of Alsace
were useless for the next quartercentury. The industrial district
around Paris had been leveled to the ground by the mobs
and Belgium looked as it had after the worst devastation of
war. I had expected to find a shambles, but my utmost anticipations
were exceeded. I could bring myself to look upon no
more and my pilot informing me that our gas was low, I
ordered him to return.</p>

<p>We were in sight of the Channel, not far from Calais, when
both starboard engines developed trouble simultaneously and
my pilot headed for a landingfield below. "What are you about,
you fool?" I shouted at him.</p>

<p>"Gasline fouled. I think I can fix it in a few minutes,
Mr Weener."</p>

<p>"Not down among those savages. We wouldnt have a
chance."</p>

<p>"We wouldnt have a chance over the Channel, sir. I'd rather
risk my neck among fellow humans than in the water."</p>

<p>"Maybe you would, but I wouldnt. Straighten out the plane
and go on."</p>

<p>"Sorry, Mr Weener; I'm going to have to land here."</p>

<p>And in spite of my protests he did so. I was instantly proved
right, for before we came to a stop we were surrounded by an
assortment of filthy and emaciated men and women bearing
scythes and pitchforks, shouting, yelling and gesticulating,
making in fact, such an uproar that no comprehension was
possible. However, there was no misunderstanding their
brusque motions ordering us away from the plane or the
threatening noises which reinforced the command. No sooner
had we reluctantly complied than they proceeded methodically
to puncture the tires and smash the propellers.</p>

<p>My horror at this marooning among the degenerates was not
lessened by their ugly and illdisposed looks and I feared they
would not be content with smashing the plane, but would take
out their animus against those who had not sunk into their
own bestial state by destroying us as well. Since I do not speak
much French, I could only say to the man nearest me, a sinister<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
fellow in a blue smock with a brown stockingcap on his
head, "C'est un disgrace, &ccedil;a; je demandez le pourquoi."</p>

<p>He looked at me for a baffled moment before calling, "Jean,
Jean!"</p>

<p>Jean was even more illfavored, having a scar across his
mouth which gave him an artificial harelip. However, he spoke
English of a kind. "Your airship has been confiscated, citizen."</p>

<p>"What the devil do you mean? That plane is my personal
property."</p>

<p>"There is no personal property in the Republic One and
Indivisible," replied Jean. "Be thankful your life is spared,
Citizen Englishman, and go without further argumentations."</p>

<p>I suppose it was reasonable to take this advice, but I could
not resist informing him, "I am not an Englishman, but an
American. We also had a Republic one and indivisible."</p>

<p>He shook his head. "On your ways, citizen. The Republic
does not make distinctions between one bourgeois and another."</p>

<p>I looked around for the pilot, but he had vanished. Alone,
furious at the act of robbery and not a little apprehensive, I
began walking toward the coast; but I was not steeled against
isolation among the barbarians of the Continent, nor dressed
for such an excursion. Between anxiety lest I run into a less
pompous and more bloodthirsty group of representatives of
the Republic One and Indivisible&mdash;when it had come into being,
how far its authority extended or how long it lasted I never
learned&mdash;and the burning and blistering of my feet in their
thinsoled shoes, I doubt if I was more than a few miles from
the airfield and therefore many from the coast when darkness
fell. I kept on, tired, anxious, hungry, in no better plight than
thousands of other wretches who at the same moment were
heading the same way under identical conditions.</p>

<p>The only advantage of traveling by night was the removal
of my fear of the intentions of men, but nature made up for
this by putting her own obstacles in my way. The hedgerows
which had been allowed to grow wild, the unrepaired roadways,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
sunken and marked by deep holes and ruts and a hundred
other pitfalls made my progress agonizingly slow.</p>

<p>As the moon rose I had a sudden feeling of being near water,
and coming out from a thicket I was confirmed in this by seeing
the light break into ripples on an uneven surface. But
tragically, it was not the Channel I had come upon, merely a
river, too wide to cross, which though it undoubtedly led to
my goal, would increase the length of my journey by many
miles. I'm afraid I gave way to a quite unmanly weakness as I
threw myself upon the hard ground and thought of my miserable
fate.</p>

<p>I may have lain there for ten minutes, or twenty. The moon
went behind a cloud, the air grew chilly. I was nerving myself
to get up and resume my journey&mdash;though to what purpose I
could not conceive for I would be little better off on a Norman
beach than inland&mdash;when a timid hand was put upon my shoulder
and someone said questioningly, "Angleterre?"</p>

<p>I sprang up. "England. Oh, yes, England. Can you help me
get there?"</p>

<p>The moon stayed covered and I could not see his face in the
dark. "England," he said. "Yes, I'll take you."</p>

<p>I followed him to a little backwater, where was beached a
rowboat. Even by feel, in the blackness, it seemed to me a very
small and frail craft to chance the voyage across the choppy sea,
but I had no choice. I seated myself in the stern while he took
the oars, cast off and rowed us down the river toward the
estuary.</p>

<p>I decided he must be one of that company of smugglers who
were ferrying refugees into Britain despite the strictest watch.
No doubt he thinks to make a pretty penny for tonight's work,
I thought, but no coastguard would turn back Albert Weener.
I would pay him well for his help, but he could not blackmail
me for fabulous ransom.</p>

<p>Still the moon did not come out. My eyes, accustoming themselves
to the dark, vaguely discerned the shape opposite me
and I saw he was a short man, but beyond this I could not distinguish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
his features. The river broadened, the air became
salty, the wind rose and soon the little boat was bobbing up
and down in a manner to give discomfort to my stomach. The
water, building terraces and battlements, reflected enough
light to impress me with the diminutiveness of the boat, set
in the vastness on which it floated.</p>

<p>Behind us the French coast was a looming mass, then a thick
blob, finally a thin blur hardly perceptible to strained eyes.
I was thoroughly seasick, retching and vomiting over the narrow
freeboard. Steadily and rhythmically the man rowed with
tireless arms, apparently unaffected by the boat's leaping and
dropping in response to the impulse of the waves and in my
intervals of relief from nausea I reflected that he must have
gained plenty of practice, that he was an old hand in making
this trip. It was a peculiar way to gain wealth, I thought,
caught in another spasm of sickness, enriching oneself on the
misery of others.</p>

<p>I vomited and dozed, dozed and vomited. The night was
endless, the wind was bitter. What riches, I wondered, could
compensate a man for such hardships? By the time the wanderers
got to the Channel they could not very well have much
left and unless my smuggler were gifted with secondsight he
could not know, judging by the way he had accosted me,
whether he was carrying a man who could pay &pound;10, &pound;100 or
&pound;500 for the accommodation. Well, I philosophized, it takes
all kinds to make a world, and who am I to say this illicit trafficker
isnt doing as much good in his way as I in mine?</p>

<p>I don't know when my nausea finally left me, unless it was
after nothing whatever remained in my stomach. I sat limp
and cold, conscious only of the erratic bobbing of the little
vessel and the ceaseless rhythm of the oars. At last, unbelievably,
the sky turned from black to gray. I could not believe it
anything but an optical illusion in the endless night and I
strained to dissipate whatever biliousness was affecting my
vision. But it was dawn, sure enough, and soon it revealed the
pettish, wallowing Channel and the fragile outline of our boat,
even tinier than I had conceived. I shuddered with more than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
cold&mdash;had I known what a cockleshell it was I might have
paused before trusting my life so readily to it.</p>

<p>Line by line the increasing light drew the countenance of
my guide. At first he was nothing but a shape, well muffled,
with some kind of flat cap upon his head. A little more light
revealed a glittering eye, more, a great, hooked nose with wide
nostrils. He was a man of uncertain age, bordering upon the
elderly, with a black skullcap under which curled outward
two silverygray horns of hair. The lower part of his face was
covered with a grizzled beard.</p>

<p>He must have been studying me as intently, for he now
broke the silence which had prevailed all night. "You are not
a poor man," he announced accusingly. "How is it you have
waited so long?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid youve made a mistake in me, my friend," I told
him jovially, "we shan't be making an illegal entry. I am resident
in England and can come home at any time."</p>

<p>He was silent; from disappointment, I concluded. "Never
mind, I'll pay you as much as a refugee&mdash;within reason."</p>

<p>"You are a follower of reason, sir?"</p>

<p>I tried hard to make out more of his still obscured face for
there was a note of irony in his voice. "I believe we'd all be
better off if everyone were to accept things philosophically.
Responsible people will find a way to end our troubles eventually
and in the meantime madness and violence&mdash;" I waved my
hand to the French coast behind&mdash;"don't help at all."</p>

<p>"Ah," he said without pausing in his rowing, "men alone,
then, will solve Man's problem."</p>

<p>"Who else?"</p>

<p>"Who Else, indeed?"</p>

<p>The smuggler's answer or confirmation or whatever the
equivocal echo was irritated me. "You think our problems can
be solved from the outside?"</p>

<p>He managed to shrug his shoulders without breaking the
rhythm of his arms. "Perhaps my English is unequal to understanding
what you mean by outside. All the forces I know are
represented within."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>

<p>I was baffled and switched the subject to more immediate
themes. "Are we about halfway, do you think?"</p>

<p>The light now exposed him fully. His hands were small and
I doubted if the arms extending from them were muscular,
but he radiated an air of great vitality. His face was lined, his
eyes fierce under outthrust eyebrows, his lips&mdash;where the crisp
waves of his beard permitted them to show&mdash;stern, but his
whole demeanor was not unkindly.</p>

<p>"It is easy to measure how far we have come, but who can
say how far we have to go?"</p>

<p>This metaphysical doubletalk annoyed me. "I don't know
what is happening to people," I said. "Either they act like
those over there," I gestured toward the Republic One and
Indivisible, "or else they become mystics."</p>

<p>"You find questions without immediate answers mystical,
sir?"</p>

<p>"I like my questions to be susceptible to an answer of some
kind."</p>

<p>"You are a man of thought."</p>

<p>It amused me to speak intimately to this stranger. "I have
lived inside myself a great many years. Naturally my mind has
not been idle all the while."</p>

<p>"You have not married?"</p>

<p>"I never had the time."</p>

<p>"Ah." He rowed quietly for some moments. "'Never had
the time,'" he repeated thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"You think marriage is important?"</p>

<p>"A man without children disowns his parents."</p>

<p>"Sounds like a proverb."</p>

<p>"It is not. Just an observation. I suppose since you have not
had the time to marry you have devoted your life to good
works."</p>

<p>"I have given employment to many, and help to the pauperized."</p>

<p>"It is commanded to be charitable."</p>

<p>"I have given millions of dollars&mdash;hundreds of thousands of
pounds to philanthropies."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>

<p>"Anonymously, of course. You must be a godly man, sir."</p>

<p>"I am an agnostic. I do not know if there is such a thing."</p>

<p>He shook his head. "Beneath us there are fish who do not
know it is the sea in which they swim; above us there are birds
unaware of the reaches of the sky. The fish have no conception
of sky; the birds know nothing of the deep. They are agnostics
also."</p>

<p>"Well, it doesnt seem to do them any harm. Fishes continue
to spawn and birds to nest without the benefits of esoteric
knowledge."</p>

<p>"Exactly. Fish remain fish in happy ignorance; doubt does
not cause a bird to falter in its flight."</p>

<p>The sun was pushed into the air from the waters as a ball is
pushed by the thumb and forefinger. The chalkcliffs were outlined
ahead of me and I calculated we had little more than an
hour to go. "You have chosen a strange way of earning a living,
my friend," I ventured at last.</p>

<p>"Upon some is laid the yoke of the Law, others depend upon
the sun for light," he said. "Perhaps, like yourself, I have
committed some great sin and am expiating it in this manner."</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean. I am conscious of no sin&mdash;if
I understand the meaning of the theological term."</p>

<p>"'We have trespassed,'" he murmured dreamily, "'we have
been faithless, we have robbed, we have spoken basely, we
have committed iniquity, we have wrought unrighteousness&mdash;&mdash;'"</p>

<p>"Since the rational world discarded the superstitions of religion
halfacentury ago," I said, "we have learned that good and
evil are relative terms; without meaning, actually."</p>

<p>For the first time he suspended his oars and the boat wallowed
crazily. "Excuse me," he resumed his exertions. "Good
is evil sometimes and evil is good upon occasion?"</p>

<p>"It depends on circumstances and the point of view. What
is beneficial at one time and place may be detrimental under
other circumstances."</p>

<p>"Ah. Green is green today, but it was yellow yesterday and
will be blue tomorrow."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>

<p>"Even such an exaggeration could be defended; however,
that was not my meaning."</p>

<p>"'We have wrought unrighteousness, we have been presumptuous,
we have done violence, we have forged lies, we
have counseled evil, we have lied, we have scoffed, we have
revolted, we have blasphemed, we have been rebellious, we
have acted perversely, we have transgressed, we have persecuted&mdash;&mdash;'"</p>

<p>"Perhaps you have," I interrupted with some asperity, "but
I don't belong in that category. Far from persecuting, I have
always believed in tolerance. Live and let live, I always say.
People can't help the color of their skins or the race they were
born into."</p>

<p>"And if they could they would naturally choose to be white
northEuropean gentiles."</p>

<p>"Why should anyone voluntarily embrace a status of inconvenience?"</p>

<p>"Why, indeed? 'We have persecuted, we have been stiffnecked,
we have done wickedly, we have corrupted ourselves,
we have committed abominations, we have gone astray and we
have led astray....'"</p>

<p>We both fell silent after this catalogue, quite inapplicable
to the situation, and it was with heartfelt thanks I distinguished
each fault and seam in the Dover Cliffs as well as the
breaking line of surf below.</p>

<p>I presumed because of what I'd said about legal entry he was
not avoiding the coastguard, but with a practiced oar he suddenly
veered and drove us onto a minute sandy beach at the
foot of the cliffs, obviously unfrequented and probably unknown
to officialdom. A narrow yet clearly defined path led
upward; this was evidently his customary haven. Were I an
emotional man I would have kissed the little strip of shingle,
as it was I contented myself with a deep sigh of thanksgiving.</p>

<p>My guide stood on the sand, smoothing the long, shapeless
garment he wore against his spare body. He had taken a small
book from his pocket and was mumbling some unintelligible
words aloud. I was struck again by the nervous vigor of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
man which had given him the strength to row all night against
a harsh sea&mdash;and presumably would generate the energy necessary
for the return trip.</p>

<p>I pulled out my wallet and extracted two &pound;100 banknotes.
No one could say Albert Weener didnt reward service handsomely.
"Here you are, my friend," I said, "and thank you."</p>

<p>"I accept your thanks." He bowed slightly, putting his hands
behind him and moving toward his boat.</p>

<p>Perversely, since he seemed bent on rejecting my reward,
I became anxious to press it upon him. "Don't be foolish," I
argued. "This is a perilous game, this running in of refugees.
You can't do it for pleasure."</p>

<p>"It is a work of charity."</p>

<p>I don't know how this shabby fellow conceived charity, but
I had never understood that virtue to conflict with the law.
"You mean you ferry all these strays for nothing?"</p>

<p>"My payment is predetermined and exact."</p>

<p>"You are foolish. Anyone using your boat for illegal entry
would be glad to give everything he possessed for the trip."</p>

<p>"There are many penniless ones."</p>

<p>"Need that be your concern&mdash;to the extent of risking your
life and devoting all your time?"</p>

<p>"I can speak for no one but myself. It need be my concern."</p>

<p>"One man can't do much. Oh, don't think I don't sympathize
with your attitude. I too pity these poor people deeply;
I have given thousands of pounds to relieve them."</p>

<p>"Their plight touches your heart?"</p>

<p>"Indeed it does. Never in all history have so many been so
wretched through no fault of their own."</p>

<p>"Ah," he agreed thoughtfully. "For you it is something
strange and pathetic."</p>

<p>"Tragic would be a better word."</p>

<p>"But for us it is an old story."</p>

<p>He pushed his boat into the water. "An old story," he
repeated.</p>

<p>"Wait, wait&mdash;the money!"</p>

<p>He jumped in and began rowing. I waved the banknotes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
ridiculously in the air. His body bent backward and forward,
urging the boat away from me with each pull. "Your money!"
I yelled.</p>

<p>He moved steadily toward the French shore. I watched him
recede into the Channel mists and thought, another madman.
I turned away at last and began to ascend the path up the cliff.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">91.</span> <span class="num2">W</span>hen I finally got back to Hampshire,
worn out by my ordeal and feeling as though I'd aged
ten years, there was a message from Miss Francis on my desk.
Even her bumptious rudeness could not conceal the jubilation
with which she'd penned it.</p>

<p>"To assuage your natural fear for the continued safety of
Albert Weener's invaluable person, I hasten to inform you
that I believe I have a workable compound. It may be a mere
matter of weeks now before we shall begin to roll back <i>Cynodon

<h3>Mr Weener Sees It Through</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">92.</span> <span class="num2">W</span>hether it was from the exposure I
endured on that dreadful trip or from disease germs which
must have been plentiful among the continental savages and
the man who rowed me back to England, I don't know, but
that night I was seized with a violent chill, an aching head and
a dry, enervating fever. I sent for the doctor and went to bed
and it was a week before I was myself enough to be cognizant
of what was going on around me.</p>

<p>During my illness I was delirious and I'm sure I afforded my
nurses plentiful occasion to snicker at the ravings of someone
of no inconsiderable importance as he lay helpless and sick.
"Paper and pencil, you kep callin for, Mr Weener&mdash;an you
that elpless you couldnt old up your own and. You said you
ad to write a book&mdash;the Istory of the Grass. To purge yourself,
you said. Lor, Mr Weener, doctors don't prescribe purges no
more&mdash;that went out before the first war."</p>

<p>I never had a great deal of patience with theories of psychology&mdash;they
seem to smack too much of the confessional and
the catechism. But as I understand it, it is claimed that there
exists what is called an unconscious&mdash;a reservoir of all sorts of
thoughts lurking behind the conscious mind. The desires of
this unconscious are powerful and tend to be expressed any
time the conscious mind is offguard. Whether this metaphysical
construction be valid or not, it seemed to me that some
such thing had taken place while I was sick and my unconscious,
or whatever it was, had outlined a very sensible project.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
There was no reason why I shouldnt write such a history as
soon as I could take the time from my affairs. Certainly I had
the talent for it and I believed it would give me some satisfaction.</p>

<p>My pleasant speculations and plans for this literary venture
were interrupted, as was my convalescence, by the loss of the
Sahara depots. When I got the news, my principal concern
wasnt for the incalculable damage to Consolidated Pemmican.
My initial reaction was amazement at the ability of the devilgrass
to make its way so rapidly across a sterile and waterless
waste. In the years since its first appearance it had truly
adapted itself to any climate, altitude, or condition confronting
it. A few months before, the catastrophe would have
plunged me into profound depression; now, with the resilience
of recovery added to Miss Francis' assurance, it became
merely another setback soon to be redeemed.</p>

<p>From Senegal, near the middle of the great African bulge, to
Tunis at the continent's northern edge, up through Sardinia
and Corsica, the latest front of the Grass was arrayed. It occupied
most of Italy and climbed the Alps to bite the eastern tip
from Switzerland. It took Bavaria and the rest of Germany
beyond the Weser. Only the Netherlands, Belgium, France,
Spain and Portugal&mdash;a geographical purist might have added
Luxembourg, Andorra and Monaco&mdash;remained untouched
upon the Continent. Into this insignificant territory and the
British Isles were packed all that was left of the world's two
billion people: a blinded, starving mob, driven mad by terror.
How many there were there, squirming, struggling, dying in a
desperate unwillingness to give up existence, no matter how
intolerable, no one could calculate; any more than a census
could be taken of the numbers buried beneath the Grass now
holding untroubled sway over ninetenths of the globe.</p>

<p>Watchers were set upon the English coast in a manner reminiscent
of 1940. I don't know exactly what value the giving
of the alarm would have been; nevertheless, night and day
eyes were strained through binoculars and telescopes for signs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
of the unique green on the horizon or the first seed slipping
through to find a home on insular soil.</p>

<p>Miss Francis' optimistic news had been communicated to
the authorities, but not given out over the BBC. This was an
obvious precaution against a wave of concerted invasion by
the fear obsessed horde beyond the Channel. While they might
respect our barriers if the hope for survival was dim, a chance
pickup of the news that the Grass was doomed would be sure
to send its destined victims frenziedly seeking a refuge until
the consummation occurred. If such a thing happened our
tiny islands would be suffocated by refugees, our stores would
not last a week, and we should all go down to destruction
together.</p>

<p>But in the mysterious way of rumor, the news spread to
hearten the islanders. They had always been determined to
fight the Grass&mdash;if necessary as the Chinese had fought it till
overwhelmed&mdash;indeed, what other course had they? But now
their need was only to hold it at bay until the new discovery
could be implemented. And there was good chance of its being
put to use before the Grass had got far beyond the Rhine.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">93.</span> <span class="num2">N</span>ow we were on the last lap, my
interest in the progress of the scientific tests was such that I
insisted upon being present at every field experiment. For
some reason Miss Francis didnt care for this and tried to dissuade
me, both by her disagreeable manner (her eccentricity&mdash;craziness
would undoubtedly be a more accurate term&mdash;increased
daily) and by her assurances I couldnt possibly find
anything to hold my attention there. But of course I overruled
her and didnt miss a single one of these fascinating if sometimes
disappointing trials.</p>

<p>I vividly recall the first one. She had reiterated there would
be nothing worth watching&mdash;even at best no spectacular results
were expected&mdash;but I made myself one of the party just
the same. The theater was a particularly dismal part of Dartmoor
and for some reason, probably known only to herself,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
she had chosen dawn for the time. We arrived, cold and uncomfortable,
in two saloon cars, the second one holding several
long cylinders similar to the oxygen or acetylene tanks
commonly used in American industry.</p>

<p>There was a great deal of mysterious consultation between
Miss Francis and her assistants, punctuated by ritualistic
samplings of the vegetation and soil. When these ceremonies
were complete four stakes and a wooden mallet were produced
and the corners of a square, about 200 by 200, were pegged.
The cylinders were unloaded, set in place at equal intervals
along one side of the square, turncocks and nozzles with
elongated sprayjets attached, and the valves opened.</p>

<p>A fine mist issued forth, settling gently over the stakedout
area. Miss Francis, her toothpick suspended, stood in rapt
contemplation. At the end of thirty minutes the spray was
turned off and the containers rolled back into the car. Except
for the artificial dew upon it, the moor looked exactly as it
had before.</p>

<p>"Well, Weener, are you going to stand there and gawk for
the next twentyfour hours or are you coming back with us?"</p>

<p>I could tell by their expressions how horrified her assistants
were at the rudeness to which I'd become so accustomed I no
longer noticed it. "It's not a success, then?" I asked.</p>

<p>"How the devil do I know? I have no crystal ball to show
me tomorrow. Anyway, even if it works on the miscellaneous
growth here I havent the remotest idea how the Grass will react
to it. This is only a remote preliminary, as I told you before,
and why you encumbered us with your inquisitiveness
is more than I can see."</p>

<p>"Youre coming back tomorrow, then?"</p>

<p>"Naturally. Did you think I just put this on for fun&mdash;in
order to go away and forget it? Weener, I always knew those
who made money werent particularly brilliant, but arent you
a little backward, even for a billionaire?"</p>

<p>There was no doubt she indulged in these boorish discourtesies
simply to buoy up her own ego, which must have
suffered greatly. She presumed on her sex and my tolerance,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
taking the same pleasure in baiting me, on whom she was
utterly dependent, as a terrier does in annoying a Saint Bernard,
knowing the big dog's chivalry will protect the pest.</p>

<p>When we returned the square was clean of all growth, as
though scraped with a sharp knife. Only traces of powdery
dust, not yet scattered by a breeze, lay here and there. I was
jubilant, but Miss Francis affected an air of contempt. "Ive
proved nothing I didnt know before, merely confirmed the
powers of the deterrent&mdash;under optimum conditions. It has
killed ordinary grass and some miscellaneous weeds&mdash;and that's
all I can say so far. What it will do to inoculated <i>Cynodon
dactylon</i> I have no more idea than you."</p>

<p>"But youre going to try it on the Grass immediately?"</p>

<p>"No, I'm not," she answered shortly.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Weener, either leave these things in my hands or else go do
them yourself. You annoy me."</p>

<p>I was not to be put off in so cavalier a manner and after we
parted I sent for one of her assistants and ordered him to load
a plane with some of the cylinders and fly to the Continent
for the purpose of using the stuff directly against the Grass.
When he protested such a test would be quite useless and he
could not bring himself to such disloyalty to his "chief," as
he quaintly called Miss Francis, I had to threaten him with
instant discharge and blacklist before he came to his senses.
I'm sorry to say he turned out to be a completely unreliable
young man, for the plane and its crew were never heard from
again&mdash;a loss I felt deeply, for planes were becoming scarce in
England.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">94.</span> <span class="num2">A</span>s a matter of fact everything, except
illegal entrants who continued to evade the authorities,
was becoming scarce in England now. The stocks of petroleum,
acquired from the last untouched wells and refineries
and hoarded so zealously, had been limited by the storage
space available. We had a tremendous amount of food on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
hand, yet with our abnormally swollen population and the
constant knowledge that the British Isles were not agriculturally
selfsufficient, wartime rationing of the utmost stringency
was resorted to. The people accepted their hardships,
lightened by the hope given by Miss Francis' work&mdash;in turn
made possible only by me.</p>

<p>Though I chafed at her procrastination and forced myself
to swallow her incivilities, I put my personal reactions aside
and with hardly an exception turned over my entire scientific
resources to Miss Francis, making all my research laboratories
subordinate to her, subject only to a prudent check, exercised
by a governing board of practical businessmen. The government
cooperated wholeheartedly and thousands worked night
and day devising possible variants of the basic compound and
means of applying it under all conditions. It was a race between
the Grass and the conquerors of the Grass; there was no
doubt as to the outcome; the only question now was how far
the Grass would get before it was finally stopped.</p>

<p>The second experiment was carried out on the South
Downs. The containers were the same, the ceremonious interchange
repeated, only the area staked out covered about four
times as much ground as the first. We departed as before,
leaving the meadow apparently unharmed, returning to find
the square dead and wasted.</p>

<p>Once more I urged her to turn the compound directly upon
the Grass. "What if it isnt perfected? What harm can it do?
Maybe it's advanced enough to halt the Grass even if it doesnt
kill it."</p>

<p>She stabbed at her chest with the toothpick. "Isnt it horrible
to live in a world of intellectual sucklings? How can I explain
what's going on? I have a basic compound in the same sense
... in the same sense, let us say, that I know iodine to be a
poison. Yes, that will do. If I wish to kill a man&mdash;some millionaire&mdash;and
administer too little, far from acting as a poison it
will be positively beneficial. This is a miserably oversimplified
analogy&mdash;perhaps you will understand it."</p>

<p>I was extremely dissatisfied, knowing as I did the rapidly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
worsening situation. The Grass was in the Iberian Peninsula,
in Provence, Burgundy, Lorraine, Champagne and Holland.
The people were restive, no longer appeased by the tentative
promise of redemption through Miss Francis' efforts. The
BBC named a date for the first attack upon the Grass, contradicted
itself, said sensible men would understand these
matters couldnt be pinned down to hours and minutes. There
were riots at Clydeside and in South Wales and I feared the
looting of my warehouses in view of the terrible scarcity of
food.</p>

<p>It wasnt only the immediate situation which was bad, but
the longrange one. Oil reserves in the United Kingdom were
practically exhausted. So were non-native metals. Vital machinery
needed immediate replacement. As soon as Miss
Francis was ready to go into action the strain upon our obsolescent
technology and hungerweakened manpower would be
crippling.</p>

<p>The general mood was not lightened by the clergy, professionally
gloating over approaching doom, nor by the speculations
of the scientists, who were now predicting an insect and
aquatic world. Man, they said, could not adapt himself to the
Grass&mdash;this was proved to the hilt by the tragedy of the Russian
armies in the Last War&mdash;but insects had, fishes didnt need to,
and birds, especially those who nested above the snowline,
might possibly be able to. Undoubtedly these orders could in
time produce a creature equal if not superior to <i>Homo sapiens</i>
and the march of progress stood a chance to continue after an
hiatus of a few million years or so.</p>

<p>The combination of these airy and abstract speculations
with their slowness to produce something tangible to help
us at this crisis first angered and then profoundly depressed
me. I could only look upon the whole conglomeration&mdash;scientists,
politicians, common man and all&mdash;as thoroughly irresponsible.
I remembered how I had applied myself diligently,
toiling, planning, imagining, to reach my present position and
how a fraction of that effort, if it had been exerted by these
people, could stop the Grass overnight.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span></p>

<p>In this frameofmind my thoughts occupied themselves more
and more with the idea I had uttered during my illness. To
write a history of the Grass would at least afford me an escape
from the daily irritation of concerning myself exclusively
with the incompetents and blunderers. Not being the type of
person to undertake anything I was not prepared to finish, I
thought it might be advisable to keep a journal, first to get
myself in the mood for the larger work and later to have a daytoday
account of momentous events as seen by someone
uniquely connected with the Grass.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">95.</span> <i><span class="num2">J</span>uly 14</i>: Lunch at Chequers with the
PM. Very gloomy. Says Miss F may have to be nationalized.
Feeble joke by undersecretary about nationalization of women
proving unsuccessful during the Bolshevik revolution. Ignoring
this assured the PM we would get a more definite date
from her during the week. Privately agreed her dilatoriness
unpardonable. I shall speak to F tomorrow.</p>

<p>Home by 5. Gardeners slovenly; signs of neglect everywhere.
Called in S and gave him a good goingover; said he
was doing the best he could. Sighed for the good old days&mdash;Tony
Preblesham would never have shuffled like that. Shall
I have to get a new steward&mdash;and would he be any improvement?</p>

<p>Very bored after dinner. Almost decided to start the book.
Scribbled a few paragraphs&mdash;they didnt sound too bad. Sleep
on it.</p>

<p><i>July 15</i>: BBC this morning reported Grass in the Ardennes.
This undoubtedly means a new influx from the Continent&mdash;the
coastguard is practically powerless&mdash;and we will be picked
clean. In spite of the news F absolutely refuses to set a definite
date. Kept my temper with difficulty.</p>

<p>Came home to be annoyed by Mrs H telling me K, one of
the housemaids, had been got into trouble by an undergardener.
Asked Mrs H whether or not it wasnt her function
as a housekeeper to take care of such details. Mrs H very tart,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
said in normal times she was perfectly capable of handling the
situation, but with everything going to pieces she didnt know
whether to turn off K or the undergardener, or both, or
neither. I thought her attitude toward me symptomatic of the
general slackness and demoralization setting in all over. Instructed
her to discharge them both and not bother me again
with such trivia. Tried to phone the PM, but the line was
down. Another symptom.</p>

<p>As a sort of refuge, went to the library and wrote for four
solid hours, relating the origin of the Grass. Feeling much
better afterwards, rang for Mrs H and told her merely to give
K a leave of absence and discharge only the guilty undergardener.
I could see she didnt approve my leniency.</p>

<p><i>July 16</i>: A maniac somehow got into The Ivies and forced
his way into the library where I was writing. A horrible looking
fellow, with a tortured face, he waved a pistol in front of
me, ranting phrases reminiscent of oldfashioned soapbox oratory.
I am not ashamed to admit nervousness, for this is not
the first time my life has been threatened since attaining
prominence. Happily, the madman's aim was as wild as his
speech, and though he fired four shots, all lodged in the plaster.
S, Mrs H and B, hearing the noise, rushed in and grabbed
him.</p>

<p><i>July 17</i>: A little upset by the episode of the wouldbe assassin,
I decided to go up to London for the day. The library
would be unusable anyway, while the walls and ceiling were
being repaired.</p>

<p><i>July 18</i>: Shaking experience. Can write no more at the
moment.</p>

<p><i>Later</i>: I was walking in Regent Square when I saw her.
As beautiful and mysterious as she was last time. But now my
tongue was not tied; oblivious to restraint and ridicule, I
shouted, rushed after her.</p>

<p>I&mdash; But, really, that is all. I rushed after her, but she disappeared
in the idle crowd. People looked at me curiously
as I pushed and shoved, peering, crying, "Wait, wait a minute!"
But she was gone.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Still later</i>: I shall go back to The Ivies tonight. If I stay
longer in London I fear I shall be subject to further hallucinations.</p>

<p>If it was an hallucination and not the Strange Lady herself.</p>

<p><i>July 19</i>: Grass reported in Lyons. F has new experiment
scheduled for tomorrow. Despite upset condition, I wrote six
pages of my history. The work of concentrating, under the
circumstances, was terrific but I feel repaid for my effort. I
am the captain of my soul.</p>

<p>S says the cottagers no longer paying rent. Told him to evict
them.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">96.</span> <i><span class="num2">J</span>uly 20</i>: F's test today on some underbrush
in a wood. Think in future I shall go only to inspect
the results; the spraying is very dull. Wrote four pages and
tore them up. S says it is impossible to evict tenants. Asked
him if there were no law left in England and he answered,
"Not very much." I shall begin looking about for a new
steward. Hear the Tharios are in London. Grass reported beyond
the Vosges.</p>

<p><i>July 21</i>: Usual aftermath of F's experiment. Not a sign of
vegetation left. In the face of this, simply maddening that she
doesnt get into action directly against the Grass. Got no satisfaction
from her by direct questioning. Can her whole attitude
be motivated by some sort of diseased and magnified
femininity?</p>

<p><i>July 22</i>: Noticed Burlet at breakfast had left off his striped
waistcoat. Such a thing has never happened before. Not surprised
when he requested interview. He began by saying it
had been quite some time since he put before me his plan for
what he calls "vertical cities." Not caring for his attitude,
pointed out that it was quite outside my province as an employer
to wetnurse any schemes of his; nevertheless, out of
kindness I had brought it to the attention of the proper
people.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span></p>

<p>"But, Mr Weener, sir, people are losing their lives."</p>

<p>"So you said before, Burlet."</p>

<p>"And if nothing is done the time will come when you also
will be killed by refugees or drowned by the Grass."</p>

<p>"That borders on impertinence, Burlet."</p>

<p>"I ope I ave never forgot my place. But umanity takes precedence
over umility."</p>

<p>"That will be all, Burlet."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir. If convenient, I should like to give notice
as of the first."</p>

<p>"All right, Burlet."</p>

<p>When he left, I was unreasonably disturbed. If I had pressed
his scheme&mdash;but it was impracticable....</p>

<p><i>July 23</i>: The Grass is in the neighborhood of Antwerp and
questions are being asked in Parliament. Unless the government
can offer satisfactory assurances of action by F they are
expected to fall tomorrow. Assured the PM I would put the
utmost pressure on F, but I know it will do no good. The
woman is mad; I would have her certified and locked up in an
asylum in a second if only some other scientist would show
some signs of getting results. Did not write a word on my
history today.</p>

<p><i>July 24</i>: Debate in Parliament. Got nothing from F but
rudeness. Wrote considerably on my book. I would like to
invite Stuart Thario to The Ivies, if for no other reason than
to show I bear no malice, but perhaps it would not be wise.</p>

<p>Riots in Sheffield.</p>

<p><i>July 25</i>: Vote of confidence in Commons. The PM asked
the indulgence of the House and played a record of Churchill's
famous speech: "... Turning to the question of invasion
... We shall not fail; we shall go on to the end ... We
shall defend our island whatever the cost. We shall fight on
beaches, in cities and on the hills. We shall never surrender."
Result, the government squeaked through; 209 for, 199
against, 176 abstaining. No one satisfied with the results.</p>

<p>Mrs H came to me in great distress. It seems the larder is
empty of chutney, curry and worcestershire sauce and none<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
of these items can be purchased at Fortnum &amp; Mason's or anywhere
else. I assured her it was a matter of indifference to me
since I did not care particularly for any of these delicacies.</p>

<p>Mrs H swept this aside as entirely irrelevant. "No wellconducted
establishment, Mr Weener, is without chutney, curry
or worcestershire." The insularity of the English is incredible.
I have not tasted cocacola, hotdogs, or had a bottle of ketchup
for more than a year, but I don't complain.</p>

<p>The Grass is in the Schelde estuary, almost within sight of
the English coast. I got nothing written on my history today.</p>

<p><i>July 26</i>: Invited to see film of a flight made about six
months ago over what was once the United States. Very moving.
New York still recognizable from the awkward shapes
assumed there by the Grass. In the harbor a strange mound of
vegetation. Several of the ladies wept.</p>

<p>I went home and thought about George Thario and carried
my history of the Grass up until the time it crossed Hollywood
Boulevard.</p>

<p><i>July 27</i>: The Grass is now in Ostend, definitely in sight
from the coast.</p>

<p><i>July 28</i>: Grass in Dunkirk.</p>

<p><i>July 29</i>: F astounded me this morning by coming to The
Ivies, an unprecedented thing. She is (finally!!!) about to undertake
tests directly against the Grass and wants airplanes
and gasoline. I impressed upon her how limited our facilities
are and how they cannot be frittered away. She screamed at
me insanely (the woman is positively dangerous in these
frenzies) and I finally calmed her with the assurance&mdash;only
superficially exact&mdash;that I was dependent on the authorities
for these supplies. At length I persuaded her she could just
as well use motor launches since the Grass had now reached
the Channel. She reluctantly agreed and grumblingly departed.
My joy and relief in her belated action was dampened
by her arrogant intemperance. Can a woman so unbalanced
really save humanity?</p>

<p><i>July 30</i>: Wrote.</p>

<p><i>July 31</i>: Wrote.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span></p>

<p><i>August 1</i>: Attended at breakfast by footman. Extremely
awkward and irritating. Inquired, what had happened to
Burlet? Reminded he had left. Annoyed at this typical lack of
consideration on the part of the employed classes. We give
them work and they respond with a lack of gratitude which is
amazing.</p>

<p>In spite of vexations, I brought my history up to the wiping
out of Los Angeles. Leave with F and party at midnight for
the tests.</p>

<p><i>August 4</i>: It is impossible for me to set down the extent
of the depression which besets me. F's assurance she has
learned a great deal from the tests and didnt for a minute
expect to drive the Grass back at this point doesnt counter
the fact that her latest spray hadnt the slightest effect on the
green mass which has now replaced the sandy beaches of the
Pas de Calais. At great personal inconvenience I accompanied
her on her fruitless mission and I didnt find her excuses, even
when clothed in scientific verbiage, adequate compensation
for the wasted time.</p>

<p><i>August 5</i>: The government finally fell today and there is
talk of a coalition of national unity, with the Queen herself
assuming extraordinary powers. There was general agreement
that this would be quite unconstitutional, but that won't
prevent its being done anyway.</p>

<p>In spite of the stringent watch against refugees the population
has so enlarged that rations have again been cut. Mrs H
says she doesnt know where the next meal is coming from, but
I feel she exaggerates. Farmers, I hear, absolutely refuse to
deliver grain.</p>

<p><i>August 6</i>: Interview with S C. Offered him all the facilities
now at the disposal of F. I admitted I was not without influence
and could almost promise him a knighthood or an earldom.
He said, "Mr Weener, I don't need the offer of reward;
I'm doing my best right now. But I'm proceeding along entirely
different lines than Miss Francis. If I were to take her
work over at this point I'd nullify whatever advance she's made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
and not help my own research by as much as an inch." If C
can't replace F, I don't know who can. Very despondent, but
wrote just the same. Can't give in to moods.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">97.</span> <i><span class="num2">A</span>ugust 7</i>: BBC announced this morning
the Grass is in Bordeaux and under the Defense of the
Realm Act every man and woman is automatically in service
and will be solely responsible for a hundred square feet of the
island's surface, their stations to be assigned by the chief
county constable. Tried to get Sir H C&mdash;no phone service.</p>

<p>Wrote on my history till noon. What a lot of bluster professional
authors make over the writing of a book&mdash;they should
have had the necessity every businessman knows for sticking
eternally to it, and experience in a newspaper cityroom&mdash;as I
had. Just before luncheon an overworked looking police constable
bicycled over with designations of the areas each of us
is responsible for. Sir H very thoughtfully allotted the patrolling
of my library to me.</p>

<p><i>August 8</i>: Grass in Troyes and Ch&acirc;lons. The assignment of
everyone to a definite post has raised the general spirit. Ive
always said discipline was what people needed in times of
crisis&mdash;takes their minds off their troubles.</p>

<p>The prime minister spoke briefly over the wireless, announcing
he was in constant touch with all the researchworkers,
including Miss Francis. Annoyed at his going over
my head this way&mdash;a quite unnecessary discourtesy.</p>

<p>Marked incivility and slipshodness among the staff. Spoke
to Mrs H and to S; both agreed it was deplorable, saw no immediate
help for it. So upset by petty annoyances I could not
write on my history.</p>

<p><i>August 9</i>: Glorious news. The BBC announced the antiGrass
compound would be perfected before Christmas.</p>

<p><i>August 10</i>: F denies validity of the wireless report. Said no
one with the remotest trace of intelligence would make such a
statement. "Is it impossible to have the compound by then?"
I asked her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's not impossible to have it by tomorrow morning. Good
heavens, Weener, can't you understand? I'm not a soothsayer."</p>

<p>Can it be some scientist I know nothing of is getting ahead
of her? Very dishonorable of the government if so.</p>

<p>Despite uncertainties wrote three more pages.</p>

<p><i>August 11</i>: Riots in Manchester and Birmingham. Demagogues
pointing out that even if the antiGrass compound is
perfected by Christmas it will be too late to save Britain. They
don't count apparently on the Channel holding the plague
back for long. Possible the government may fall, which won't
disturb me, as I prefer the other party anyway.</p>

<p><i>August 12</i>: After a long period of silence from the Continent,
Radio Mondiale went on the air from Cherbourg asking
permission for the government to come to London.</p>

<p><i>August 13</i>: The watch on the south and east coasts has been
tripled, more as a precaution against the neverceasing wave of
invasion than the Grass. It has been necessary to turn machineguns
on the immigrant boats&mdash;purely in selfdefense.</p>

<p>The rioting in the Midlands has died down, possibly on the
double assurance that permission for the removal of the
French government had been refused (I cannot find out, to
satisfy my idle curiosity, if it is still the Republic One and
Indivisible which made the request or whether that creation
was succeeded by a less eccentric one), and that Christmas was
a conservative estimate for the perfection of the compound&mdash;a
last possible date.</p>

<p>Brought my history up to the Last War.</p>

<p><i>August 14</i>: Very disheartening talk with the PM today.
It seems the whole business of setting a date was an error from
beginning to end. No one gave any such promise. It dare not
be denied now, however, for fear of the effect upon the public.
I must begin to think seriously of moving to Ireland.</p>

<p><i>August 15</i>: Grass reported in the Faeroes. French Channel
coast covered to the mouth of the Seine. What is the matter
with F? Is it possible the failure of the last experiment blasted
all her hopes? If so, she should have told me, so I might urge
on others working along different lines.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span></p>

<p>Motored to the laboratory and spoke about moving to Ireland.
She agreed it might be a wise precaution. "You know,
Weener, the jackass who said Christmas mightnt have been so
far out afterall." She seemed very confident.</p>

<p>Came home relieved of all my recent pessimism and brought
my book down to the overrunning of the United States. I am
not a morbid man, but I pray I may live to set foot on my
native soil once again.</p>

<p><i>August 16</i>: No new reports from France. Can the Grass be
slowing down? Wrote furiously.</p>

<p><i>August 17</i>: Wrote for nearly ten hours. Definitely decided
to discharge S; he is thoroughly incapable. No word from
France, but there is a general feeling of great optimism.</p>

<p><i>August 18</i>: Bad news, very bad news. The Grass has jumped
two hundred miles, from the Faeroes to the Shetlands and we
are menaced on three sides. Went up to London to arrange
for a place in Ireland. I cannot say I was well received by the
Irish agent, a discourteous and surly fellow. Left orders to
contact Dublin direct as soon as phone service is resumed.</p>

<p><i>August 19</i>: It seems Burlet has been interesting all sorts of
radicals and crackpots in his scheme for glassenclosed cities.
Local MP very reproachful; "You should have warned me,
Mr Weener." I asked him if he honestly thought the idea
practical. "That isnt the point. Not the point at all."</p>

<p>As far as can be learned France is completely gone now. It
is supposed a fragment of Spain and Portugal are still free of
the Grass and a little bit of Africa. It is almost unbelievable
that all these millions have perished and that the only untouched
land left is these islands.</p>

<p>Many irritations. The phone is in order for perhaps halfanhour
a day. Only the wireless approximates a normal schedule.
Wrote six pages.</p>

<p><i>August 20</i>: Dublin apologized profusely for the stupidity
of their agent and offered me a residence near Kilkenny and
all the facilities of Trinity for F and her staff. Told F, who
merely grunted. She then stated she wanted a completely
equipped seagoing laboratory for work along the French coast.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
I said I'd see what could be done. Much encouraged by this
request.</p>

<p><i>August 21</i>: The arrogance and shortsightedness of the
workingclass is beyond belief. They refuse absolutely to work
for wages any longer. I now have to pay for all services in
concentrates. Even the warehouse guards, previously so loyal,
will accept nothing but food. I foresee a rapid dwindling of
our precious supplies under this onslaught.</p>

<p><i>August 22</i>: With all the shipping Consolidated Pemmican
owns I can find nothing suitable for F's work. Almost decided
to outfit my personal yacht <i>Sisyphus</i> for that purpose. It would
be convenient to use for the Irish removal if that becomes
necessary.</p>

<p>Burlet's ideas have found their way into Parliament. The
Independent Labour member from South Tooting asked the
Home Minister why nothing had been done about vertical
cities. The Home Minister replied that Britons never would
permit a stolon of the Grass to grow on English soil and therefore
such fantastic ideas were superfluous. ILP MP not satisfied.</p>

<p><i>August 23</i>: Ordered the <i>Sisyphus</i> to Southampton for refitting.
It will cost me thousands of tons of precious concentrates,
besides lying for weeks in a dangerously exposed spot.
But I can make a better deal in Southampton than elsewhere
and I refuse to be infected by the general cowardice of the
masses.</p>

<p>Speaking of the general temper, I must say there has been a
stiffening of spirit in the last week or so; very laudable, and
encouraging to one who believes in the essential dignity of
human nature.</p>

<p>No new report on the Grass for four days.</p>

<p><i>August 24</i>: The member from South Tooting has introduced
a bill to start construction at once of one of Burlet's
cities. The bill calls for the conscription of manpower for the
work and whatever materials may be necessary, without compensation.
The last clause is of course aimed directly at me.
Naturally, the bill will not pass.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span></p>

<p><i>August 25</i>: Flew to Kilkenny. I fear this will be one of the
last plane trips I can make for a long time, since the store of
aviation gasoline is just about exhausted. The place is much
more beautiful than Hampshire, but deplorably inconvenient.
However, since the Irish are still willing to work for
money, I have ordered extensive alterations.</p>

<p><i>August 26</i>: I have stopped all sale of concentrates. Since
money will buy nothing, it would be foolish of me to give my
most precious asset away. Of course we cut the deliveries down
to a mere dribble some time ago, but even that dribble could
bleed me to death in time. I have doubled the wages&mdash;in concentrates&mdash;of
the warehouse guards in fear of possible looting.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">98.</span> <i><span class="num2">A</span>ugust 29</i>: The last three days have
been filled with terror and suspense. It began when a patrolling
shepherd on the Isle of Skye found a suspicious clump of grass.
All conditions favored the invader: the spot was isolated, communications
were difficult, local labor was inadequate. The
exhaustion of the fuel supply made it impossible to fly grassfighters
in and men had to be sent by sea with makeshift
equipment. Happily there were two supercyclone fans at
Lochinvar which had been shipped there by mistake and these
were immediately dispatched to the threatened area.</p>

<p>The clump was fought with fire and dynamite, with the fans
preventing the broken stolons from rooting themselves again.
After a period of grave anxiety and doubt there seems to be no
question this particular peril has been averted&mdash;not a trace of
the threatening weed remains. The Queen went personally to
Westminster Abbey to give thanks.</p>

<p><i>August 30</i>: Work on the <i>Sisyphus</i> proceeding slowly. I have
decided to keep my own cabin intact and have the adjoining
one fitted for a writing room. Then I can accompany F on her
experimental excursions and not lose any time on my book,
which is progressing famously. What a satisfaction creative
endeavor is!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span></p>

<p><i>August 31</i>: The bill for the construction of Burlet's city
was debated today. The PM stated flatly that the Grass would
be overcome before the city could be built. (Cheers) The Hon.
Member from South Tooting rose to inquire if the Right Hon.
Member could offer something besides his bare word for this?
(Groans, faint applause, cries of "Shame," "No gentleman,"
etcetera) The Home Minister begged to inform the Hon. Member
from South Tooting that Her Majesty's government had
gone deeply into the question of the socalled vertical cities
long before the Hon. Member had ever heard of them. Did
the Hon. Member ever consider, no matter how many precautions
were taken in the building of conduits for a water supply,
that seeds of the Grass would undoubtedly find their way in
through that medium? Or through the air intakes, no matter
how high? (Dead silence) The Hon. Member from Stoke Pogis
asked if the opposition to his Hon. friend's bill wasnt the result
of pressure by a certain capitalist, concerned principally with
the manufacture of concentrated foods? (Groans and catcalls)</p>

<p>The Chancellor of the Exchequer inquired if the Hon. Member
meant to impugn the integrity of the government? (Cries
of "Shame," "No," "Unthinkable," etcetera) If not, what did
the Hon. Member imply? (Obstinate silence) Since no answer
was forthcoming he would move for a division. Result: the
bill overwhelmingly voted down.</p>

<p>Since the Skye excitement everyone is inclined to be jittery
and nerves are stretched tightly. When I told F she had missed
a great opportunity to test her formula in Scotland she blew
up and called me a meddling parasite. This is pretty good
coming from a dependent. Only my forbearance and consideration
for her sex kept me from turning her out on the spot.</p>

<p><i>September 1</i>: Encouraged by the Skye episode, a group of
volunteers is being formed to attempt an attack on the Grass
covering the Channel Islands. More than can possibly be used
are offering their services. I subscribed &pound;10,000 toward the
venture.</p>

<p>Preparations for moving to Kilkenny almost complete. Even
if F gets going by December and the Scottish repulse is permanent,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
I believe I shall be better off in Ireland until the first
definite victory is won against the Grass.</p>

<p><i>September 5</i>: The Grass moved again and this time all
attempts to repulse it failed. It is now firmly entrenched on
both the Orkneys and the Hebrides. Terrible pessimism.
Commons voted "No confidence" 422 to 117 and my old
friend D N is back in office.</p>

<p><i>September 6</i>: <i>Sisyphus</i> almost ready. Find I can get a crew
to work for wages when not in port. Luncheon at Chequers.
PM urges me not to leave England as it might shake confidence.
I told him I would consider the matter.</p>

<p><i>September 7</i>: F says she is ready to make new tests and what
is holding up work on the <i>Sisyphus</i>? Replied it was complete
except for my cabins. She had the effrontery to say these werent
important and she was ready to go ahead without me. I pointed
out that the <i>Sisyphus</i> was my property and it would not sail
until I was properly accommodated.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">99.</span> <i><span class="num2">S</span>eptember 8</i>: I shall not move to Ireland
afterall. The Grass has a foothold in Ulster.</p>

<p><i>September 9</i>: The Irish are swarming into Scotland and
Wales. Impossible to keep them out.</p>

<p><i>September 10</i>: Donegal overrun.</p>

<p><i>September 12</i>: On board the <i>Sisyphus</i>. Wrote an incredible
amount; still beyond me how anybody can call the fashioning
of a book work. We left Southampton last night on a full tide
and are now cruising the Channel about four miles from the
French coast. It is quite unbelievable&mdash;under this tropical
green blanket lies the continent of Europe, the home of civilization.
And the bodies of millions, too. Except for a few gulls
who shriek their way inland and return dejectedly, there is
not a living thing in sight but the Grass.</p>

<p>I have reserved the afterdeck to myself and as I sit here now,
scribbling these notes, I think what impresses me more than
anything else is the feeling of vitality which radiates from the
herbaceous coast. The dead continent is alive, alive as never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
before&mdash;wholly alive; moving with millions of sensitive feelers
in every direction. For the first time I have a feeling of sympathy
for Joe's constant talk of the beauty of the Grass, but in
spite of this, the question which comes to my mind is, can you
speak glibly about the beauty of something which has
strangled nearly all the world?</p>

<p><i>Later</i>: Sitting on the gently swaying deck, I was moved to
add several pages to my history. But now we are approaching
the narrower part of the Channel and the sea is getting choppy.
I shall have to give up my jottings for a while.</p>

<p><i>Still later</i>: F finally picked a spot she considered suitable&mdash;the
remains of a small harbor&mdash;and we anchored. I must say
she was overfussy&mdash;one cove is pretty much the same as another
these days. Possibly she was so choosy in order to heighten her
importance.</p>

<p>Repetition of the involved etiquette of inspecting the intended
victim and turning on the sprays; only this time the
suppressed excitement anticipating possible success made even
the preliminaries interesting. Miss Francis and her assistants
retired for a mysterious conference immediately after the
application and I stayed up late talking with the captain till
he was called away by some duty. It is now nearly two A M&mdash;in
a few hours we shall know.</p>

<p><i>September 13</i>: Horribly shaken this morning to find the
Grass unaffected. Even wondered for a moment if it were conceivable
that F would never find the right compound&mdash;that
nothing could hurt the Grass. Had I been illadvised in not
going more seriously into Burlet's vertical cities?</p>

<p>F very phlegmatic about it. Says another twelve hours of
observation may be of value. She and A rowed ashore over the
runners trailing in the water and with great difficulty succeeded
in hacking off a few runners of the sprayed Grass. I
thought her undertaking this hazard an absurd piece of
bravado&mdash;she might just as well have sent someone else.</p>

<p>Disregarding her rudeness in not inviting me, I accompanied
her unasked to her laboratory-cabin. She laid the
stolons on an enamelsurfaced table and busied herself with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
some apparatus. I could not take my eyes from these segments
of the Grass. They lay on the table, not specimens of vegetation,
but stunned creatures ready to spring to vigorous and
vengeful life when they recovered. It was impossible not to
pick one up and run it through my fingers, feeling again the
soft, electric touch.</p>

<p>Miss Francis' preparations were interminable. If she follows
such an elaborate ritual for the mere checking of an unsuccessful
experiment no wonder she is taking years to get anywhere.
My attention wandered and I started to leave the cabin when
I noticed my hand still held one of the specimens.</p>

<p>It was withered and dry.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">100.</span> <i><span class="num2">S</span>eptember 17</i>: The enthusiasm greeting
the discovery that F's reagent mortally affected the Grass
was only tempered by the dampening thought that its action
had been incomplete. What good was the lethal compound if
its work were final only when the sprayed parts were severed?</p>

<p>F seemed to think it was a great deal of good. Her manner
toward me, boisterous and quite out of keeping with our respective
positions and sexes, could almost be called friendly.
During the return to Southampton she constantly clapped me
on the back and shouted, "It's over, Weener; it's all over now."</p>

<p>"But it isnt over," I protested. "Your spray hadnt the slightest
direct effect on the Grass."</p>

<p>"Oh, that. That's nothing. A mere impediment. A matter of
time only."</p>

<p>"Time only! Good God, do you realize the Grass is halfway
through Ireland? That we are surrounded now on four sides?"</p>

<p>"A lastminute rescue is quite in the best tradition. Don't
disturb yourself; you will live to gloat over the deaths of better
men."</p>

<p>I urged the PM to be cautious about overoptimism in giving
out the news. He nodded his head solemnly in agreement, but
he evidently couldnt communicate whatever wisdom he possessed
to the BBC announcer, for he, in butter voice, spoke<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
as though Miss Francis had actually destroyed a great section
of the weed upon the French coast. There were celebrations
in the streets of London and a vast crowd visited the cenotaph
and sang <i>Rule Britannia</i>.</p>

<p><i>September 18</i>: Hoping to find F in a calmer mood, I asked
her today just how long she meant by "a matter of time"? She
shrugged it off. "Not more than four or five months," she said
blithely.</p>

<p>"In a month at most the Grass will be in Britain."</p>

<p>"Let it come," she responded callously. "We shall take the
<i>Sisyphus</i> and conclude our work there."</p>

<p>"But millions will die in the meantime," I protested.</p>

<p>She turned on me with what I can only describe as tigrish
ferocity. "Did you think of the millions you condemned to
death when you refused to sell concentrates to the Asiatic
refugees?"</p>

<p>"How could I sell to people who couldnt buy?"</p>

<p>"And the millions who died because you refused them employment?"</p>

<p>"Am I responsible for those too shiftless to fend for themselves?"</p>

<p>"'Am I my brother's keeper?' If fifty million Englishmen
die because I cannot hasten the process of trial and error, the
guilt is mine and I admit it. I do not seek to exculpate myself
by pointing a finger at you or by silly and pompous evasions
of my responsibility. If the Grass comes before I am ready, the
fault is mine. In the meantime, while one creature remains
alive, even if his initials be A W, I shall seek to preserve him.
As long as there is a foothold on land I shall try on land; and
when that fails we shall board the <i>Sisyphus</i> and finish our work
there, somewhere in the Atlantic."</p>

<p>"You mean you definitely abandon hope of perfecting your
compound before England goes?"</p>

<p>"I abandon nothing," she replied. "I think it's quite possible
I'll finish in time to save England, but I can't afford to do
anything but look forward to the worst. And that is that we'll
be driven to the sea."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span></p>

<p>I was appalled by the picture her words elicited: a few ships
containing the survivors; a world covered with the Grass.</p>

<p>"And when success is attained we shall fight our way back
inch by inch."</p>

<p>But this piece of bombast didnt hearten me. I had no desire
to fight our way back inch by inch; I wanted at least a fragment
of civilization salvaged.</p>

<p><i>September 19</i>: F has not been the only one to think of the
high seas as a final refuge. The London office has been literally
besieged by men of wealth eager to pay any price to charter
one of our ships. I have given orders to grant no more
charters for the present.</p>

<p><i>September 20</i>: The enthusiasm is subsiding and people are
beginning to ask how long it will be before they can expect
the reconquest of the Continent to begin. BBC spoke cautiously
about "perfection" of the compound for the first time,
opening the way to the implication that it doesnt work as yet.
Added quite a bit to my manuscript.</p>

<p><i>September 21</i>: Mrs H, in very dignified mood, approached
me; said she heard I had made plans to leave England in case
the Grass threatened. She asked nothing for herself, she said,
being quite content to accept whatever fate Providence had
in store for her, but, would I take her daughter and family
along on the <i>Sisyphus</i>? They would be quite useful, she added
lamely.</p>

<p>I said I would give the matter my attention, but assured
her there was no immediate danger.</p>

<p><i>September 22</i>: Grass on the Isle of Man.</p>

<p><i>September 23</i>: Ordered stocking of the <i>Sisyphus</i> with as
much concentrates as she can carry. The supply will be ample
for a full crew, F's staff and myself for at least six months.</p>

<p><i>September 24</i>: Ive known for years that F is insane, but her
latest phase is so fantastic and preposterous I can hardly credit
it. She demands flatly the <i>Sisyphus</i> take along at least fifty
"nubile females in order to restock the world after its reconquest."
After catching my breath I argued with her. The prospect
of England's loss was by no means certain yet.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good. We'll give the girls a seavoyage and land them back
safe and sound."</p>

<p>"We have enough supplies for six months; if we take along
these superfluous passengers our time will be cut to less than
three."</p>

<p>Her answer was a brutal piece of blackmail. "No women, no
go."</p>

<p>If F were a young man instead of an elderly woman I could
understand this aberration better.</p>

<p><i>September 25</i>: It seems Mrs H's grandchildren are all girls
between twelve and eighteen, which leaves the problem of fulfilling
F's ultimatum to finding fortyseven others. I have delegated
the selection to Mrs H.</p>

<p><i>September 26</i>: Grass on Skye for the second time. This invasion
was not repulsed.</p>

<p><i>September 27</i>: The cyclone fans have been set up from
Moray Firth to the Firth of Lorne. I am in two minds about
asking the Tharios to join us.</p>

<p>The bill authorizing the construction of a vertical city at
Stonehenge passed Commons.</p>

<p><i>September 28</i>: Grass reported near Aberdeen. Panic in Scotland.
No more train service.</p>

<p><i>September 29</i>: Day of fasting, humiliation and prayer proclaimed
by the Archbishop of Canterbury. Grass south of the
Dee. All mines shut down.</p>

<p><i>September 30</i>: Every seaworthy vessel, and many not seaworthy,
now under charter. I have ordered all remaining stores
of concentrates loaded on our own hulls, to be manned by
skeleton crews. They will stand by the <i>Sisyphus</i> on her voyage.
Lack of railway transportation making things difficult.</p>

<p><i>October 1</i>: They have actually broken ground at Stonehenge
for Burlet's fantastic city.</p>

<p><i>October 2</i>: Wrote on my book for nearly twelve solid hours.
The postal service has been stopped.</p>

<p><i>October 3</i>: Hearing the royal family had made no plans for
departure, the London office ventured to offer them accommodations
on one of our ships. I had always heard the House of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
Windsor was meticulous in its politeness, but I cannot characterize
their rejection of our wellmeant aid as anything but
rude.</p>

<p><i>October 4</i>: Mrs H asks, Are we to live solely on concentrates
now the shops are shut? My query as to whether this
seemed objectionable to her was evaded.</p>

<p><i>October 5</i>: Grass in Inverness and Perthshire.</p>

<p><i>October 6</i>: F announces she is ready for another test. Under
present conditions, the journey to Scotland being out of the
question, we decided to use the <i>Sisyphus</i> again and the French
coast. Leaving tomorrow.</p>

<p><i>October 11</i>: This constant series of frustrations is beyond
endurance. In spite of F's noncommittal pessimism anticipating
success only after the Grass has covered England, I feel
she is merely making some sort of propitiatory gesture when she
looks on the darkest side of the picture that way. As for myself
I'm convinced the Grass will be stopped in a week or so. But
in the meantime F's work advances by the inch, only to be set
back again and again.</p>

<p>We repeated the previous test with just enough added success
to give our failure the quality of supreme exasperation.
This time there was no question but what the growth sprayed
actually withered within twentyfour hours. But it was not
wiped out and not long afterward it was overrun and covered
up by a new and vigorous mass. Such a victory early in the
fight would have meant something; now it is too late for such
piecemeal destruction. We must have a counteragent which
communicates its lethal effect to a larger area of the Grass than
is actually touched by it&mdash;or at very least makes the affected
spot untenable for future growth.</p>

<p>What help is it for F to rub her hands smugly and say,
"We're on the right track, all right"? Weve been on the right
track for months, but the train doesnt get anywhere.</p>

<p><i>October 12</i>: Columbus Day.</p>

<p><i>October 13</i>: Grass in Fife and Stirling. BBC urges calm.</p>

<p><i>October 14</i>: Rumor has it work abandoned at Stonehenge.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
It was a futile gesture anyway. I'm sure F will perfect the
counteragent anyday.</p>

<p><i>October 15</i>: Mrs H announced she has completed her selection
of fifty young women, adding, "I hope they will prove
satisfactory, sir." For a horrible moment I wondered if she
thought I was arranging for a harem.</p>

<p><i>October 16</i>: Decided, purely as a matter of convenience and
not from panic, such as is beginning to affect even the traditionally
stolid British, to move aboard the <i>Sisyphus</i>. Grass on
the outskirts of Edinburgh.</p>

<p><i>October 17</i>: In a burst of energy last night I brought my
history down to the Grass in Europe.</p>

<p>Disconcerting hitch. Most of the <i>Sisyphus'</i> crew, including
the captain, want to take their wives along. I find it difficult to
believe them all uxoriously wed&mdash;at any rate this is not a pleasure
excursion. Agreed the captain should take his and told
him to effect some compromise on the others. The capacity of
the <i>Sisyphus</i> is not elastic.</p>

<p><i>October 18</i>: Grass almost to the Tweed. PM on the wireless
with the assurance a counteragent will be perfected within the
week. F furious; wanted to know if I couldnt control my politicians
better. I answered meekly&mdash;really, her anger was ludicrous&mdash;that
I was an American citizen, not part of the British
electorate, and therefore had no influence over the prime
minister of Great Britain. Seriously, however, perhaps the premature
announcement will spur her on.</p>

<p>The erratic phone service finally stopped altogether.</p>

<p><i>October 19</i>: Riots and looting&mdash;unEnglish manifestations
carried out in a very English way. Hysterical orators called for
the destruction of all foreign refugees from the Grass, or at
very least their exclusion from the benefits of the lootings. In
every case the mob answered them in almost identical language:
"Fair play," "Share and share alike," "Yer nyme Itler,
maybe?" "Come orf it, sonny, oo er yew? Gord Orlmighty's
furriner, aint E?" Having heckled the speakers, they proceeded
cheerfully to clean out all stocks of available goods&mdash;the
refugees getting their just shares. There must be a peculiar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
salubrity about the English air. Otherwise Britons could
not act so differently at home and abroad.</p>

<p>Thankful indeed all Consolidated Pemmican stores safely
loaded.</p>

<p><i>October 20</i>: As anticipated, the Grass crossed the Tweed
into Northumberland, but quite unexpectedly England has
also been invaded from another quarter. Norfolk has the Grass
from Yarmouth to Cromer. F, the PM, and myself hanged in
effigy. Shall not tarry much longer.</p>

<p><i>October 21</i>: Durham and Suffolk. Consulted the captain
about a set of auxiliary sails for the <i>Sisyphus</i>. Moving aboard
tonight.</p>

<p><i>October 22</i>: Heard indirectly that the Tharios had managed
to charter a seagoing tug on shares with friends. This takes
a great load off my mind.</p>

<p>Postponed moving to the ship in order to superintend packing
of personal possessions, including the manuscript of my
history. F says it is still not impossible to perfect compound
before the Grass reaches London.</p>

<p><i>October 23</i>: On board the <i>Sisyphus</i>. What has become of the
stolid heroism of the English people? On the way down to
the ship, I ran into a crowd no better behaved than the adherents
of the Republic One and Indivisible. I mention the
episode lightly, but it was no laughing matter. I was lucky to
escape with my life.</p>

<p>Nervous and upset with the strain. I shall not return to The
Ivies till the Grass begins its retreat. Too restless to continue
my book. Paced the deck a long time.</p>

<p><i>October 24</i>: The fifty girls arrived, and a more maddening
cargo I can't imagine. I gave orders to keep them forward,
but their shrill presence nevertheless penetrates aft.</p>

<p>I hear all electricity has been cut off. Grass in Yorkshire.</p>

<p><i>October 25</i>: F came aboard with the other scientists and
immediately wanted to know why we didnt set sail. I asked
her if her work could be carried on any more easily at sea.
She shrugged her shoulders. I pointed out that only rats leave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
a sinking ship and England was far from overcome. She
favored me with one of her fixed stares.</p>

<p>"You are dithery, Weener. Your epigrams have lost their
jaunty air of discovery and your face is almost green."</p>

<p>"You would not expect me to remain unaffected by the
events around us, Miss Francis."</p>

<p>"Wouldnt I?" she retorted incomprehensibly and went below
to her cabin-laboratory.</p>

<p>The Grass is reported in Essex and Hertfordshire. I understand
there are at least two other ships equipped for research
and manned by English scientists. It would serve F right if they
perfected a counteragent first.</p>

<p>October 26: Have ordered our accompanying ships to lie
offshore, lest they be boarded by fearcrazed refugees, for the
Grass is now in the vicinity of London and England is in a
horrible state.</p>

<p>October 27: BBC transmitting from Penzance. Faint.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="num1">101.</span> <i><span class="num2">N</span>ovember 3</i>: On board the <i>Sisyphus</i> off
Scilly. The last days of England have passed. Heightening the
horror, the BBC in its final moments forwent its policy of
soothing its listeners and urging calmness upon them. Instead,
it organized an amazing news service, using thousands of
pigeons carrying messages from eyewitnesses to the station at
Penzance to give a minutebyminute account of the end.
Dispassionately and detachedly, as though this were some ordinary
disaster, announcer after announcer went on the air and
read reports; heartpiercing, anticlimactic, tragic, trivial, noble
and thoroughly English reports....</p>

<p>The people vented their futile rage and terror in mass pyromania.
Building after building, city after city was burned to
the ground. But, according to the BBC, the murderous frenzy
of the Continent was not duplicated. Inanimate things suffered;
priceless art objects were kicked around in the streets,
but houses were carefully emptied of inhabitants before being
put to the torch.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span></p>

<p>These were the spectacular happenings; the emphatic
events. Behind them, and in the majority, were quieter, duller
transactions. Churches and chapels filled with people sitting
quiet in pews, meditating; gatherings in the country, where
the participants looked at the sun, earth and sky; vast meetings
in Hyde Park proclaiming the indissoluble brotherhood of
man, even in the face of extinction.</p>

<p>We heard the Queen and her consort remained in Buckingham
Palace to the last, but this may be only romantic
rumor. At all events, England is gone now, after weathering
a millennium of unsuccessful invasions. From where I sit
peacefully, bringing my history uptodate and jotting these
notes in my diary, I can see, faintly with the naked eye or quite
distinctly through a telescope, that emerald gem set in a silver
sea. The great cities are covered; the barren moors, the lovely
lakes, the gentle streams, the forbidding crags are all mantled
in one grassy sward. England is gone, and with it the world.
What few men of forethought who have taken to ships, what
odd survivors there may be in arctic wastes or on lofty Andean
or Himalayan peaks, together with the complement of the
<i>Sisyphus</i> and its accompanying escort are all that survive of
humanity. It is an awesome thought.</p>

<p><i>Later</i>: Reading this over it seems almost as though I had
been untrue to my fundamental philosophy. The world has
gone, vanished; but perhaps it is for the best, afterall. We shall
start again in a few days with a clean slate, picking up from
where we left off&mdash;for we have books and tools and men of
learning and intelligence&mdash;to start a new and better world
the moment the Grass retreats. I am heartened by the thought.</p>

<p>Below, Miss Francis and her coworkers are striving for the
solution. After the last experiment there can be no question
as to the outcome. An hour ago I would have written that it
was deplorable this outcome couldnt be achieved before the
latest victory of the Grass. Now I begin to believe it may be
a lucky delay.</p>

<p><i>November 4</i>: What meaning have dates now? We shall have
to have a new calendar&mdash;Before the Grass and After the Grass.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span></p>

<p><i>November 5</i>: Moved by some incomprehensible morbidity
I had a stainless steel chest, complete with floats, made before
embarkation in order to place the manuscript and diary in
it should the impossible happen. I have it now on the deck
beside me as a reminder never to give way to a weak despair.
F promises me it is a matter of days if not hours till we can
return to our native element.</p>

<p><i>November 8</i>: Another test. Almost completely successful.
F certain the next one will do it. My emotions are exhausted.</p>

<p><i>November 9</i>: I have completed my history of the Grass down
to the commencement of this diary. I shall take a wellearned
rest from my literary labors for a few days. F announces a new
test&mdash;"the final one, Weener, the final one"&mdash;for tomorrow.</p>

<p><i>November 10</i>: Experiment with the now perfected compound
has been put off one more day. F is completely calm
and confident of the outcome. She is below now, making lastminute
preparations. For the first time she has infected me
with her certitude&mdash;although I never doubted ultimate success&mdash;and
I feel tomorrow will actually see the beginning of the
end for the Grass which started so long ago on Mrs Dinkman's
lawn. How far I and the world have come since then!</p>

<p>Would I go back to that day if I had the power? It seems
an absurd question, but there is no doubt we who have survived
have gained spiritual stature. Of course I do not mean
anything mystical or supernatural by this observation&mdash;we
have acquired heightened sensitivity and new perceptions.
Brother Paul, ridiculous mountebank, was yet correct in this&mdash;the
Grass chastised us rightly. Whatever sins mankind committed
have been wiped out and expiated.</p>

<p><i>Later</i>: We are out of sight of land; nothing but sea and sky,
no green anywhere. On the eve of liberation all sorts of absurd
and irrelevant thoughts jump about in my mind. The strange
lady ... Joe's symphony, burned by his mother. Whatever
happened to William Rufus Le ffa&ccedil;as&eacute; after he eschewed his
profession for superstition? And Mrs Dinkman? For some annoying
reason I am beset with the thought of Mrs Dinkman.</p>

<p>I can see her pincenez illadjusted on her nose. I can hear<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
her highpitched complaining voice bargaining with me over
the cost of inoculating her lawn. The ugly stuff of her tasteless
dress is before my eyes. It is so real to me I swear I can
see the poor, irregular lines of the weaving.</p>

<p><i>Still later</i>: I have sat here in a dull lethargy, undoubtedly
induced by my overwrought state, quite understandable in the
light of what is to happen in a few hours, my eyes on the seams
of the deck, reviewing all the things I have written in my book,
preparing myself, a way, for the glorious and triumphant
finish. But I am beset by delusions. A moment ago it was the
figure of Mrs Dinkman and now&mdash;</p>

<p>And now, by all the horror that has overcome mankind, it is
a waving, creeping, insatiable runner of the Grass.</p>

<p><i>Again</i>: I have made no attempt to pinch off the green stolon.
It must be three inches long by now and the slim end is waving
in the wind, seeking for a suitable spot to assure its hold
doubly. I touched it with my hand, but I could not bring
myself to harm it.</p>

<p>I managed to drag my eyes away from the plant and go below
to see Miss Francis. I stood outside the cabin for a long time,
listening to the noise and laughter, coupled with a note of
triumph I had never heard before and which I'm sure indicates
indubitable success. There can be no question of that.</p>

<p>There can be no question of that.</p>

<p>The stolon has pressed itself into another seam.</p>

<p>The blades are very green. They have opened themselves
to the sun and are sucking strength for the new shoots. I have
put my manuscript into the casket which floats, leaving it
open for this diary if it should be necessary. But of course such
a contingency is absurd.</p>

<p>Absolutely absurd.</p>

<p>The Grass has found another seam in the deck.</p>
